N2  - Cancer patients often develop chronic, clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes.

T1  - Subjective effects of psilocybin predict next-day differences in default mode network and medial temporal lobe functional connectivity
A1  - Barrett F, Johnson M, Griffiths R
Y1  - 2016//
Y2  - 2016//
N2  - Background: Psychedelics, or classic serotonin-2a receptor agonist hallucinogens (e.g. psilocybin and LSD), are being investigated for their therapeutic potential in patients with mood disorders and addiction. Strong psychoactive effects during psychedelic sessions, including decreases in a sense of self and increases in ratings of connectedness, positive mood, ineffability, and timelessness (operationalized as a "mystical experience") can be followed by sustained therapeutic changes, including improvement of depressive symptoms and reduction or cessation of addictive behaviors. Brain imaging studies using several different imaging modalities have identified changes in the activity and connectivity of regions of the posterior and ventral default mode network (DMN) during acute psychedelic effects. While these acute effects of psychedelics on the brain have been associated with subjective effects of spiritual experience and a decreased sense of self, little is known about the sustained effects of psychedelics on brain activity and connectivity after the acute effects of psychedelics have subsided. Thus, knowledge about the neurobiological basis of sustained therapeutic changes after psychedelic sessions is limited. The current double-blind, placebo-controlled study aimed to examine the relationship between acute psilocybin subjective effects and subsequent (next-day) differences in resting-state DMN connectivity. Methods: 18 volunteers (Age = 25-70, M = 54.2, SD = 12.6; 10 F/8 M) in a study of the effects of psilocybin on meditation were randomized to receive either a placebo (n = 9) or a high dose (25 mg/70 kg) psilocybin (n = 9) capsule before a laboratory session. Groups were matched on age (?2 = 0.9, p = n.s.), sex (t = 1.01, p = n.s.), number of previous hallucinogen uses (t = 0.07, p = n.s.), and estimated lifetime hours of meditation (t = 1.40, p = n.s.). Self-report measures of subjective experience (including the Mystical Experience Questionnaire, or MEQ, and the Challenging Experience Questionnaire, or CEQ) were assessed at the end of the session (after the effects of psilocybin had subsided). Seven minutes of resting-state fMRI data were collected the day after the session using a 3T Achieva Philips MRI scanner and echo planar imaging (TR = 2s, 37 slices, resolution = 3mm3, slice gap = 1mm, matrix = 80x80). Resting state data were preprocessed and normalized to the MNI template using SPM, screened for gross motion (Power et. al, 2012), and artifact-corrected using volume sensoring (Power et al, 2014) and 36-parameter motion correction (Satterthwaite et. al, 2013) which includes aCompCor (Behzadi et. al, 2007). Seed-based functional connectivity analyses were applied to resting-state data using the CONN toolbox. Resting-state data were parcellated using regions of interest (ROIs) defined in the Brodmann area atlas as well as additional amygdala and hippocampus ROIs defined in the Anatomy toolbox in SPM. Self-report measures and functional connectivity of DMN regions to all other ROIs were compared between placebo and psilocybin groups and correlated within the psilocybin group. Functional connectivity results were corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR, po 0.05). Results: Participants who received psilocybin scored significantly higher than those who received placebo on the MEQ and the CEQ. There were no main effects of drug condition on functional connectivity, however in those who received psilocybin, there was a significant association between MEQ scores and connectivity of DMN regions (including the posterior cingulate and lateral parietal cortices) to both executive (dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex) and limbic (amygdala) brain regions. There was also a significant association between CEQ scores and connectivity of medial temporal lobe regions, including the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus in those who received psilocybin. Conclusions: Long-term therapeutic change observed after mystical and challenging experiences with psilocybin may be related to DMN, executive, and limbic connectivity change. Sustained change in DMN connectivity is consistent with therapeutic changes observed after psychedelic sessions. The relationship between challenging experiences, limbic connectivity, and therapeutic outcomes should be further investigated.

T1  - Psilocybin-induced decrease in amygdalaputamen coupling during an event-related face discrimination task
A1  - Grimm O, Krahenmann R, Preller K, Seifritz E, Vollenweider F
Y1  - 2016//
Y2  - 2016//
N2  - Background: Psilocybin is a modulator of amygdala activity presumably via its 5HT1A/2A agonistic properties. We have recently shown that reduced amygdala activity during threat processing might underlie psilocybin's effect on emotional processing in a block-design paradigm [1]. In this study, we investigated psilocybin's effects in an event-related face discrimination task in n = 18 healthy volunteers who received psilocybin and placebo in a crossover design. Face discrimination of emotional faces relies on both prefrontal as well as subcortical structures, namely the amygdala. We hypothesized that the amygdala activity alone or as part of a network is altered during psilocybin application. This could manifest in altered salience of emotional face-processing in task activity or in task-related connectivity of the amygdala. Methods: Using a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, cross-over design, subjects received either placebo or 0.16 mg/kg oral psilocybin in two separate imaging sessions at least 14 days apart (as reported in [1]). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging, beta-series connectivity and graphtheory network analysis to characterize effective connectivity during categorization of angry, fearful or happy affective faces in contrast to affective neutral faces in the brain. As the amygdala is a key target for psilocybin's effect during emotion processing, we used the left and right amygdala as alpha-priori region-of-interest seed masks for the connectivity analysis. Results: Psilocybin (in contrast to placebo) increased reaction time for all three categories of affective stimuli in comparison to neutral stimuli. The rate of correctly recognized hits did not differ between face categories and between placebo and psilocybin. The face discrimination task demonstrated in the placebo condition a robust signal of visual cortex, fusiform cortex, limbic system namely the amygdala, prefrontal and motor cortices. During the face categorization task, there was a tendency for a stronger striatal activation during the angry face condition under psilocybin, but no difference for fearful or happy faces. During psilocybin, a beta-series connectivity analysis of the left-amygdala seed ROI showed a decrease in the connectivity with the striatum (mainly left putamen, cluster-corrected pFDR<0.03). This was not found during the happy or fearful face condition. On a behavioural level, the rate of correct classified angry faces correlated with the coupling between amygdala and putamen. The coupling correlated negatively with the sum score of altered states (TAS: r = 0.57, p = 0.015) and with anxiety (r = 0.51, p = 0.03) during psilocybin intake. Conclusion: In summary, psilocybin alters subcortical limbic networks during processing of angry faces in comparison to neutral faces. During psilocybin, the coupling between amygdala and putamen is decreased. This points to a change in salienceevaluation of angry faces, which is partly supported by the behavioral effect. The stronger coupling between amygdala and putamen during angry face discrimination, the lower the anxiety rating during psilocybin. Therefore, our results support further that psilocybin not only alters amygdala activity but exerts downward effects in the striatum.

T1  - Serotonergic modulation of emotion processing by the mixed 5-HT1A/2A receptor agonist psilocybin reduces amygdala activation to negative stimuli-a pharmacological fMRI study.
A1  - Kraehenmann R, Preller KH, Seifritz E, Vollenweider FX
Y1  - 2014//
Y2  - 2014//
N2  - Purpose: There is growing evidence supporting the notion that the serotonin (5-HT) agonist psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N,Ndimethyltryptamine), the main psychoactive principle of 'magic mushrooms', may reduce neural responses to negative stimuli and induce long-lasting positive mood and attitudes [1]. Such a profound effect on emotion and mood processes might underlie the putative antidepressant properties of psilocybin, as it has repeatedly been shown that a critical mechanism for antidepressant efficacy may be an effect which counteracts negative mood states and limbic hyperactivity in response to negative stimuli in patients with major depression. A recent clinical study [2] in patients with depression and anxiety related to advanced-stage cancer supports this notion: a single dose of psilocybin significantly decreased anxiety and increased positive mood for up to 6 months. However, the neurobiological mechanisms by which psilocybin influences emotion processing remain poorly understood. In particular, it is still unclear whether psilocybin modulates the activity of the amygdala, a region that plays a crucial role in the neural effects of antidepressants, during emotion processing, and whether any psilocybin-induced effect on amygdala activity during emotion processing is related to changes in mood state. Methods: In this study, the acute effects of low-dose psilocybin (0.16 mg/kg) on amygdala activation were measured using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotion processing task and in combination with assessment of mood changes. 25 healthy subjects (16 males, mean age 24.2+/-3.42 years) were included in the study. The study followed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Subjects received either placebo or 0.16 mg/kg oral psilocybin at two separate imaging sessions 2 weeks apart. During scanning, subjects performed an established amygdala reactivity task, using picture stimuli from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Mood changes were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: Both whole-brain voxel-wise and region of interest (ROI)-based analyses showed that right-amygdala activation in response to negative stimuli was significantly lower after psilocybin administration than after placebo administration (psilocybin mean+/-SD: 0.36+/-0.28; placebo: 0.58+/-0.36; p<0.001). Further, psilocybin significantly increased positive mood (p = 0.001), but not anxiety (p = 0.37), and this effect was correlated to psilocybininduced decrease of amygdala reactivity (r = -0.46, p<0.05). Conclusions: Results show that acute administration of lowdose psilocybin decrease amygdala reactivity to negative pictures. Notably, this effect was correlated with psilocybin-induced increase in positive mood. These findings confirm and extend previous evidence that 5-HT1A/2A receptor stimulation may induce positive mood states and decrease neural responses to negative stimuli. In addition, this study demonstrates that the amygdala, a key component within limbic structures implicated in emotion processing, may be an important neural target underlying the hypothesized antidepressant properties of psilocybin.

T1  - Psilocybin treatment for anxiety in patients with advanced-stage cancer.
A1  - Grob C
Y1  - 2012//
Y2  - 2012//
N2  - Background: From the late 1950s to the early 1970s clinical research was conducted exploring the use of hallucinogens to treat the existential anxiety, despair and isolation often associated with advanced-stage cancer. These reports described critically ill individuals undergoing psycho spiritual epiphanies, frequently with sustained improvement in anxiety, mood and quality of life. While these promising investigations were halted because of political and cultural pressures, after a thirty year hiatus the development of hallucinogen treatment research for patients with anxiety reactive to advanced-stage cancer has resumed. Methods: This presentation examines the rationale, methodology and results of a pilot investigation using psilocybin to treat the existential anxiety associated with advanced-stage cancer. Psilocybin, the active alkaloid in hallucinogenic mushrooms and a 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C agonist, was administered to 12 screened subjects diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. A double-blind, placebo-controlled methodology was employed, utilizing a moderate dosage of psilocybin, 0.2 mg/kg. Treatment sessions were conducted on the Clinical Research Unit at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Results: Safe physiological and psychological responses were documented during treatment sessions. There were no clinically significant adverse events with psilocybin. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory trait anxiety subscale demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety at 1 and 3 months after treatment. The Beck Depression Inventory revealed an improvement of mood that reached significance at 6 months; the Profile of Mood States identified mood improvement after treatment with psilocybin that approached but did not reach significance. Conclusions: This study establishes the feasibility and safety of administering moderate doses of psilocybin to patients with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. Some of the data revealed a positive trend toward improved mood and anxiety. These results support the need for more research in this long-neglected field. To that end, two new studies using psilocybin to treat cancer anxiety, at Johns Hopkins and New York University, are currently on-going. Both of these investigations are evaluating higher doses than used in the Harbor-UCLA study, allowing for greater exploration of the role of psycho-spiritual or transcendent states of consciousness in facilitating therapeutic outcomes.

N2  - Social cognition is a crucial factor influencing development, progress, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, social cognition skills are insufficiently targeted by current treatment approaches. In particular, patients suffering from depression show an increased negative reaction to social exclusion and deficits in empathy. The 5HT-1A/2A receptor agonist psilocybin has previously been shown to reduce the neural response to negative emotional stimuli. However, it is not known if this extends to negative social interaction and whether 5HT-1A/2A receptor stimulation induces changes in empathy. Given the clear need for improved treatment of sociocognitive functioning in psychiatric disorders, it is important to better understand the neuronal and neuromodulatory substrates of social cognition. In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design we therefore investigated the neural response to ostracism after the acute administration of psilocybin (0.215mg/kg) and placebo in healthy volunteers using fMRI. Furthermore, we assessed cognitive and emotional empathy using the Multifaceted Empathy Test. The neural response to social exclusion in the ACC - a brain region associated with 'social pain'- was reduced after psilocybin administration compared to placebo. Furthermore, emotional empathy was enhanced after treatment with psilocybin while no significant differences were found in cognitive empathy. These results show that the 5HT-1A/2A receptor subtypes play an important role in the modulation of socio-cognitive functioning and therefore may be relevant for the treatment of social cognition deficits in psychiatric disorders. In particular, they may be important for the normalization of empathy deficits and increased negative reaction to social exclusion in depressed patients.

T1  - Neurophysiological studies of psilocybin-induced hallucinations: Role of 5-HT2A receptors.
A1  - Vollenweider FX, Schmidt A, Kometer M
Y1  - 2012//
Y2  - 2012//
N2  - Objective: Serotonergic hallucinogens such as psilocybin produce positive-like symptoms and perceptual disturbances including visual hallucinations and deficits in visual contour processing that are reminiscent to that observed in some patients in early or acute stages of schizophrenia. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms and 5-HT receptor sites that mediate these visual perceptual alterations remain largely unknown. Methods: To further elucidate the role of 5-HT2A receptors in visual processing, we performed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial in healthy human subjects (n=20) to assess the effects of psilocybin (215 mg/kg p.o.), on prestimulus and subsequent visual stimulus-induced parieto-occipital alpha oscillations and early visual-evoked potentials and to determine whether these psilocybin-induced effects are (II) reversed by the preferential 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (50 mg p.o.) or the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone. Results: Analysis of the visual-evoked potentials revealed that psilocybin selectively increased the medial P1 potential, whereas ketanserin selectively decreased the medial P1 potential. The subsequent N170 potential was strongly decreased over the lateral occipital cortex by psilocybin and associated with the appearance of visual hallucinations and audiovisual synesthesia, both of which were completely blocked by the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin. A correlational analysis showed that the decease the N170 potential correlated with the intensity of psilocybin-induced subjective alterations in visual perceptions. In contrast to this, the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone did only moderately reduced psilocybin-induced visual disturbances and partially reversed the reduction in the N170 potential. Conclusion: The present results show that 5-HT2A rather than 5-HT1A receptor stimulation is the key mechanism for the generation of visual hallucinations and audiovisual synesthesia in psilocybin states and suggests that such a mechanism may also be responsible for the visual disturbances observed in early schizophrenia and/or Parkinson's disease.

T1  - Current perspectives on psychedelic therapy: use of serotonergic hallucinogens in clinical interventions
A1  - Garcia-Romeu A.
A1  - Richards W.A. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Humans have used serotonergic hallucinogens (i.e. psychedelics) for spiritual, ceremonial, and recreational purposes for thousands of years, but their administration as part of a structured therapeutic intervention is still a relatively novel practice within Western medical and psychological frameworks. In the mid-20th century, considerable advances were made in developing therapeutic approaches integrating administration of low (psycholytic) and high (psychedelic) doses of serotonergic hallucinogens for treatment of a variety of conditions, often incorporating psychoanalytic concepts prevalent at that time. This work contributed seminal insights regarding how these substances may be employed with efficacy and safety in targeted therapeutic interventions, including the importance of optimizing set (frame of mind) and setting (therapeutic environment). More recently, clinical and pharmacological research has revisited the effects and therapeutic potential of psychedelics utilizing a variety of approaches. The current article provides an overview of past and present models of psychedelic therapy, and discusses important considerations for future interventions incorporating the use of psychedelics in research and clinical practice.Copyright © 2018, © 2018 Institute of Psychiatry and Johns Hopkins University.

N2  - From the beginning of therapeutic research with psychedelics, music listening has been consistently used as a method to guide or support therapeutic experiences during the acute effects of psychedelic drugs. Recent findings point to the potential of music to support meaning-making, emotionality, and mental imagery after the administration of psychedelics, and suggest that music plays an important role in facilitating positive clinical outcomes of psychedelic therapy. This review explores the history of, contemporary research on, and future directions regarding the use of music in psychedelic research and therapy, and argues for more detailed and rigorous investigation of the contribution of music to the treatment of psychiatric disorders within the novel framework of psychedelic therapy.Copyright © 2018, © 2018 Institute of Psychiatry and Johns Hopkins University.

T1  - Therapeutic use of classic psychedelics to treat cancer-related psychiatric distress
A1  - Ross S. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Cancer is highly prevalent and one of the leading causes of global morbidity and mortality. Psychological and existential suffering is common in cancer patients, associated with poor psychiatric and medical outcomes. Promising early-phase clinical research (1960s to early 1970s) suggested a therapeutic signal for serotoninergic psychedelics (e.g. psilocybin, LSD) in treating cancer-related psychiatric distress. After several decades of quiescence, research on psychedelic-assisted therapy to treat psychiatric disorders in cancer patients has resumed within the last 2 decades in the US and Europe. This review article is based on a systematic search of clinical trials from 1960-2018 researching the therapeutic use of psychedelic treatment in patients with serious or terminal illnesses and related psychiatric illness. The search found 10 eligible clinical trials, with a total of 445 participants, with the vast majority of the patients having advanced or terminal cancer diagnoses. Six open label trials, published between 1964 and 1980 (n = 341), suggested that psychedelic therapy (mostly with LSD) may improve cancer-related depression, anxiety, and fear of death. Four RCTs trials were published between 2011 and 2016 (n = 104), mostly with psilocybin treatment (n = 92), and demonstrated that psychedelic-assisted treatment can produce rapid, robust, and sustained improvements in cancer-related psychological and existential distress.Copyright © 2018, © 2018 NYU Langone Medical Center.

T1  - Psychedelics as anti-inflammatory agents
A1  - Flanagan T.W.
A1  - Nichols C.D. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)2A receptor agonists have recently emerged as promising new treatment options for a variety of disorders. The recent success of these agonists, also known as psychedelics, like psilocybin for the treatment of anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and addiction, has ushered in a renaissance in the way these compounds are perceived in the medical community and populace at large. One emerging therapeutic area that holds significant promise is their use as anti-inflammatory agents. Activation of 5-HT2A receptors produces potent anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of human inflammatory disorders at sub-behavioural levels. This review discusses the role of the 5-HT2A receptor in the inflammatory response, as well as highlight studies using the 5-HT2A agonist (R)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine [(R)-DOI] to treat inflammation in cellular and animal models. It also examines potential mechanisms by which 5-HT2A agonists produce their therapeutic effects. Overall, psychedelics regulate inflammatory pathways via novel mechanisms, and may represent a new and exciting treatment strategy for several inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2018, © 2018 Institute of Psychiatry and Johns Hopkins University.

T1  - Awe: a putative mechanism underlying the effects of classic psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy
A1  - Hendricks P.S. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - A psychological model of classic psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy informed by contemporary scientific data is presented in this paper. It is suggested that classic psychedelic-occasioned mystical experience is characterized by profound awe, a discrete emotion experienced in the presence of a vast stimulus requiring accommodation of mental structures. Awe, in turn, promotes the small self, a construct that, in the extreme, is analogous to those of unitive experience and ego dissolution. The small self is conceptualized as key to understanding the downstream effects of mystical experience occasioned in the context of classic psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. With this novel theoretical framework in mind, a number of clinical implications and recommendations are provided so as to advance this incipient field of study.Copyright © 2018, © 2018 Institute of Psychiatry and Johns Hopkins University.

N2  - In recent years, there is renewed interest in the study of various hallucinogens for their potential therapeutic effects. In the United States of America (USA), the abuse potential assessment of a drug is carried out as part of the general safety and efficacy evaluation of a drug. Additionally, the abuse potential assessment is taken under consideration in determining if a drug needs to be subject to controls to minimize the abuse of the drug once on the market. This assessment is conducted for all new drugs with central nervous system (CNS) activity, that are chemically or pharmacologically similar to other drugs with known abuse potential, or drugs that produce psychoactive effects predictive of abuse, such as euphoria and hallucinations. This paper describes the regulatory framework for evaluating the abuse potential of new drugs, with emphasis on hallucinogens. The paper discusses the role of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the evaluation of the abuse potential of drugs and its role in drug control, and provides an overview of the controlled status of hallucinogens and the requirements to conduct research with Schedule I substances in the USA.

N2  - Background: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin are serotonergic hallucinogens that are used primarily for recreational abuse. Small studies evaluated the efficacy of LSD and psilocybin for several psychiatric conditions. There are limited safety or toxicity data for either of these substances, especially in large populations. Method(s): This was a retrospective analysis of single-substance exposures of LSD or psilocybin-containing mushrooms (PcMs) reported to United States poison centers from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2016. The study describes the most frequent toxicities, management sites, and medical outcomes. Result(s): A total of 5883 PcM and 3554 LSD exposures were included. Most patients were between 13 and 29 years of age (83.9% PcM, 88.9% LSD) and primarily male (77.9% PcM, 74.1% LSD). Most common clinical effects were hallucinations (45.8% PcM, 37.4% LSD), agitation (24.1% PcM, 42.4% LSD), and tachycardia (18.0% PcM, 38.6% LSD). Serious clinical effects were infrequent, but included hyperthermia, seizures, coma, increased serum creatinine, and cardiac arrest. Most patients were treated and released from the emergency department. More LSD patients were admitted to critical care and non-critical care units than PcM patients. Moderate effect was the most frequent outcome for both substances (61.0% PcM, 62.3% LSD). Conclusion(s): These data find that LSD and PcM use occurs primarily in adolescents and young adults, who experience mild to moderate adverse effects. Serious effects are infrequent but can occur. While most LSD and PcM users require only emergency department management, LSD use is more likely to require medical admission.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Rationale: We reviewed the concepts and empirical findings in studies with psychedelics and entactogens related to positive psychology - the study of healthy human functioning, well-being and eudaemonia. It is an unresolved question how beneficial effects of psychedelics and entactogens are related to the potential risks of these substances - particularly in non-clinical settings. Method(s): We searched in PubMed, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Library for controlled clinical and epidemiological studies which applied concepts from positive psychology. We included N = 77 eligible studies with 9876 participants published before November 1st, 2017: (1) quantitative studies (N = 54), (2) preliminary or exploratory studies and reviews not including meta-analyses (N = 17), and (3) studies evidencing primarily negative results (N = 6). Result(s): Positive psychology concepts have been applied for measuring effects of clinical trials, recreational and ceremonial use of psychedelics and entactogens. Psychedelics and entactogens were shown to produce acute and long-term effects on mood, well-being, prosocial behaviours, empathy, cognitive flexibility, creativity, personality factors like openness, value orientations, nature-relatedness, spirituality, self-transcendence and mindfulness-related capabilities. Conclusion(s): There is preliminary evidence for beneficial effects of psychedelics and entactogens on measures of positive psychology in clinical and healthy populations, however their sustainability remains largely unresolved. The reported results must be considered preliminary due to methodological restrictions. Since longitudinal data on both positive and adverse effects of psychedelics are lacking, more rigorous and standardized measures from positive psychology should be applied in less biased populations with prospective longitudinal designs to carefully assess the benefit-risk-ratio.

N2  - Scientific curiosity and fascination have played a key role in human research with psychedelics along with the hope that perceptual alterations and heightened insight could benefit well-being and play a role in the treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders. These motivations need to be tempered by a realistic assessment of the hurdles to be cleared for therapeutic use. Development of a psychedelic drug for treatment of a serious psychiatric disorder presents substantial although not insurmountable challenges. While the varied psychedelic agents described in this chapter share some properties, they have a range of pharmacologic effects that are reflected in the gradation in intensity of hallucinogenic effects from the classical agents to DMT, MDMA, ketamine, dextromethorphan and new drugs with activity in the serotonergic system. The common link seems to be serotonergic effects modulated by NMDA and other neurotransmitter effects. The range of hallucinogens suggest that they are distinct pharmacologic agents and will not be equally safe or effective in therapeutic targets. Newly synthesized specific and selective agents modeled on the legacy agents may be worth considering. Defining therapeutic targets that represent unmet medical need, addressing market and commercial issues, and finding treatment settings to safely test and use such drugs make the human testing of psychedelics not only interesting but also very challenging.

T1  - Evaluating the abuse potential of psychedelic drugs as part of the safety pharmacology assessment for medical use in humans

N2  - Psychedelics comprise drugs come from various pharmacological classes including 5-HT2A agonists, indirect 5-HT agonists, e.g., MDMA, NMDA antagonists and kappa-opioid receptor agonists. There is resurgence in developing psychedelics to treat psychiatric disorders with high unmet clinical need. Many, but not all, psychedelics are schedule 1 controlled drugs (CDs), i.e., no approved medical use. For existing psychedelics in development, regulatory approval will require a move from schedule 1 to a CD schedule for drugs with medical use, i.e., schedules 2-5. Although abuse of the psychedelics is well documented, a systematic preclinical and clinical evaluation of the risks they pose in a medical-use setting does not exist. We describe the non-clinical tests required for a regulatory evaluation of abuse/dependence risks, i.e., drug-discrimination, intravenous self-administration and physical dependence liability. A synopsis of the existing data for the various types of psychedelics is provided and we describe our findings with psychedelic drugs in these models. FDA recently issued its guidance on abuse/dependence evaluation of drug-candidates (CDER/FDA, 2017). We critically review the guidance, discuss the impact this document will have on non-clinical abuse/dependence testing, and offer advice on how non-clinical abuse/dependence experiments can be designed to meet not only the expectations of FDA, but also other regulatory agencies. Finally, we offer views on how these non-clinical tests can be refined to provide more meaningful information to aid the assessment of the risks posed by CNS drug-candidates for abuse and physical dependence.

N2  - The classical psychedelic drugs, including psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide and mescaline, were used extensively in psychiatry before they were placed in Schedule I of the UN Convention on Drugs in 1967. Experimentation and clinical trials undertaken prior to legal sanction suggest that they are not helpful for those with established psychotic disorders and should be avoided in those liable to develop them. However, those with so-called 'psychoneurotic' disorders sometimes benefited considerably from their tendency to 'loosen' otherwise fixed, maladaptive patterns of cognition and behaviour, particularly when given in a supportive, therapeutic setting. Pre-prohibition studies in this area were sub-optimal, although a recent systematic review in unipolar mood disorder and a meta-analysis in alcoholism have both suggested efficacy. The incidence of serious adverse events appears to be low. Since 2006, there have been several pilot trials and randomised controlled trials using psychedelics (mostly psilocybin) in various non-psychotic psychiatric disorders. These have provided encouraging results that provide initial evidence of safety and efficacy, however the regulatory and legal hurdles to licensing psychedelics as medicines are formidable. This paper summarises clinical trials using psychedelics pre and post prohibition, discusses the methodological challenges of performing good quality trials in this area and considers a strategic approach to the legal and regulatory barriers to licensing psychedelics as a treatment in mainstream psychiatry.

T1  - Increased amygdala responses to emotional faces after psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression

N2  - Recent evidence indicates that psilocybin with psychological support may be effective for treating depression. Some studies have found that patients with depression show heightened amygdala responses to fearful faces and there is reliable evidence that treatment with SSRIs attenuates amygdala responses (Ma, 2015). We hypothesised that amygdala responses to emotional faces would be altered post-treatment with psilocybin. In this open-label study, 20 individuals diagnosed with moderate to severe, treatment-resistant depression, underwent two separate dosing sessions with psilocybin. Psychological support was provided before, during and after these sessions and 19 completed fMRI scans one week prior to the first session and one day after the second and last. Neutral, fearful and happy faces were presented in the scanner and analyses focused on the amygdala. Group results revealed rapid and enduring improvements in depressive symptoms post psilocybin. Increased responses to fearful and happy faces were observed in the right amygdala post-treatment, and right amygdala increases to fearful versus neutral faces were predictive of clinical improvements at 1-week. Psilocybin with psychological support was associated with increased amygdala responses to emotional stimuli, an opposite effect to previous findings with SSRIs. This suggests fundamental differences in these treatments' therapeutic actions, with SSRIs mitigating negative emotions and psilocybin allowing patients to confront and work through them. Based on the present results, we propose that psilocybin with psychological support is a treatment approach that potentially revives emotional responsiveness in depression, enabling patients to reconnect with their emotions.

T1  - Psychedelics: Where we are now, why we got here, what we must do

N2  - The purpose of this commentary is to provide an introduction to this special issue of Neuropharmacology with a historical perspective of psychedelic drug research, their use in psychiatric disorders, research-restricting regulatory controls, and their recent emergence as potential breakthrough therapies for several brain-related disorders. It begins with the discovery of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and its promising development as a treatment for several types of mental illnesses during the 1940s. This was followed by its abuse and stigmatization in the 1960s that ultimately led to the placement of LSD and other psychedelic drugs into the most restrictively regulated drug schedule of the United States Controlled Substances Act (Schedule I) in 1970 and its international counterparts. These regulatory controls severely constrained development of psychedelic substances and their potential for clinical research in psychiatric disorders. Despite the limitations, there was continued research into brain mechanisms of action for psychedelic drugs with potential clinical applications which began during the 1990s and early 2000s. Finding pathways to accelerate clinical research in psychedelic drug development is supported by the growing body of research findings that are documented throughout this special issue of Neuropharmacology. Accumulated research to date suggests psychedelic drug assisted psychotherapy may emerge as a potential breakthrough treatment for several types of mental illnesses including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and addiction that are refractory to current evidenced based therapies. This research equally shows promise in advancing the understanding of the brain, brain related functioning, and the consequential effects of untreated brain related diseases that have been implicated in causing and/or exacerbating numerous physical disease state conditions. The authors conclude that more must be done to effectively address mental illnesses and brain related diseases which have become so pervasive, destructive, and whose treatments are becoming increasingly resistant to current evidenced based therapies.

N2  - The development of 5-HT2A receptor agonists has been considerably marginalized since the demonstration that the tryptaminergic drugs, LSD and psilocybin, or the phenylakylamine drugs, mescaline and DOI, exert their hallucinogenic properties via the stimulation of 5-HT2A receptors. Nonetheless, the ability of drugs to stimulate 5-HT2A receptors is not necessarily associated with psychedelic experience and the hallucinogenic properties are still not understood. Several studies have increased interest in stimulating 5-HT2A receptors in various CNS diseases. (7R)-3-bromo-2, 5-dimethoxy-bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-1,3,5-trien-7-yl]methanamine (TCB-2) which was synthetized in 2006 presents a high affinity with human and rat 5-HT2A receptors. Its main feature of interest is that it preferentially stimulates the phospholipase C and not phospholipase A2 pathway, which is at variance with several hallucinogenic drugs. Preference for TCB-2 has increased in preclinical studies and it exhibits subtle differences compared to DOI or LSD in some molecular, cellular and behavioral studies. The purpose of this review is to take a position on the use of TCB-2 as a pharmacological tool. A careful reading of the literature has revealed that the suspected hallucinogenic properties of TCB-2 cannot firmly be ascertained while its pharmacological profile is unknown and likely not selective at 5-HT2A receptors.

N2  - Depression and anxiety are psychiatric diagnoses commonly associated with low quality of life and low percentage of responsiveness by patients treated with currently available drugs. Thus, research into alternative compounds to treat these disorders is essential to guarantee a patient's remission. The last decade has witnessed a revamped interest for the application of psychedelic medicine for the treatment of mental disorders due to anecdotal reports and clinical studies which show that low doses of D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin may have antidepressant effects. LSD and psilocybin have demonstrated mood-modulating properties likely due to their capacity to modulate serotonergic (5-HT), dopaminergic (DA) and glutamatergic systems. LSD, belonging to the category of "classic halluginogens," interacts with the 5-HT system through 5HT1A, and 5HT2A receptors, with the DA system through D2 receptors, and indirectly also the glutamatergic neurotransmission thought the recruitment of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Randomized clinical studies have confirmed its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in humans. Thus, in this chapter, we will review the pharmacology of psychedelic drugs, report the most striking clinical evidence which substantiate the therapeutic potentials of these fascinating compounds in mood disorders, and look into the horizon of where psychedelic medicine is heading.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The search for the universal laws of human brain function is still on-going but progress is being made. Here we describe the novel concepts of connectome harmonics and connectome-harmonic decomposition, which can be used to characterize the brain activity associated with any mental state. We use this new frequency-specific language to describe the brain activity elicited by psilocybin and LSD and find remarkably similar effects in terms of increases in total energy and power, as well as frequency-specific energy changes and repertoire expansion. In addition, we find enhanced signatures of criticality suggesting that the brain dynamics tune toward criticality in both psychedelic elicited states. Overall, our findings provide new evidence for the remarkable ability of psychedelics to change the spatiotemporal dynamics of the human brain.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The entropic brain hypothesis proposes that within upper and lower limits, after which consciousness may be lost, the entropy of spontaneous brain activity indexes the informational richness of conscious states. Here the hypothesis is revisited four years on from its original publication. It is shown that the principle that the entropy of brain activity is elevated in the psychedelic state is increasingly well supported by separate and independent studies and analyses, and evidence for greater brain criticality under psychedelics is also highlighted. It is argued that heightened brain criticality enables the brain to be more sensitive to intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations which may translate as a heightened susceptibility to "set" and "setting". This updated version of the original entropic brain hypothesis now offers more concrete information on specific measures of brain entropy and suggests new studies to scrutinise it further, as well as examine its utility for describing and informing the treatment of psychiatric and neurological conditions such as depression and disorders of consciousness.

N2  - The effects of hallucinogenic drugs on the human brain have been studied since the earliest days of neuroimaging in the 1990s. However, approaches are often hard to compare and results are heterogeneous. In this chapter, we summarize studies investigating the effects of hallucinogens on the resting brain, with a special emphasis on replicability and limitations. In previous studies, similarities were observed between psilocybin, LSD, and ayahuasca, with respect to decreases in cerebral blood flow and increases in global functional connectivity in the precuneus and thalamus. Additionally, LSD consistently decreased functional connectivity within distinct resting state networks. Little convergence was observed for connectivity between networks and for blood flow in other brain regions. Although these studies are limited by small sample sizes and might be biased by unspecific drug effects on physiological parameters and the vascular system, current results indicate that neuroimaging could be a useful tool to elucidate the neuronal correlates of hallucinogenic effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - This review assesses the abuse potential of medically-administered psilocybin, following the structure of the 8 factors of the US Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Research suggests the potential safety and efficacy of psilocybin in treating cancer-related psychiatric distress and substance use disorders, setting the occasion for this review. A more extensive assessment of abuse potential according to an 8-factor analysis would eventually be required to guide appropriate schedule placement. Psilocybin, like other 5-HT2A agonist classic psychedelics, has limited reinforcing effects, supporting marginal, transient non-human self-administration. Nonetheless, mushrooms with variable psilocybin content are used illicitly, with a few lifetime use occasions being normative among users. Potential harms include dangerous behavior in unprepared, unsupervised users, and exacerbation of mental illness in those with or predisposed to psychotic disorders. However, scope of use and associated harms are low compared to prototypical abused drugs, and the medical model addresses these concerns with dose control, patient screening, preparation and follow-up, and session supervision in a medical facility. CONCLUSION(S): (1) psilocybin has an abuse potential appropriate for CSA scheduling if approved as medicine; (2) psilocybin can provide therapeutic benefits that may support the development of an approvable New Drug Application (NDA) but further studies are required which this review describes; (3) adverse effects of medical psilocybin are manageable when administered according to risk management approaches; and (4) although further study is required, this review suggests that placement in Schedule IV may be appropriate if a psilocybin-containing medicine is approved.

N2  - Recent developments in neuroaesthetics have heightened the need for causative approaches to more deeply understand the mechanism underlying perception, emotion, and aesthetic experiences. This has recently been the topic for empirical work, employing several causative methods for changing brain activity, as well as comparative assessments of individuals with brain damage or disease. However, one area of study with high potential, and indeed a long history of often nonscientific use in the area of aesthetics and art, employing psychopharmacological chemicals as means of changing brain function, has not been systematically utilized. This chapter reviews the literature on this topic, analyzing neuroendocrinological (neurochemical) approaches and mechanisms that might be used to causatively study the aesthetic brain. We focus on four relevant neuromodulatory systems potentially related to aesthetic experience: the dopaminergic, serotonergic, cannabinoid, and the opioidergic system. We build a bridge to psychopharmacological methods and review drug-induced behavioral and neurobiological consequences. We conclude with a discussion of hypotheses and suggestions for future research.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Headache disorders are common, debilitating, and, in many cases, inadequately managed by existing treatments. Although clinical trials of cannabis for neuropathic pain have shown promising results, there has been limited research on its use, specifically for headache disorders. This review considers historical prescription practices, summarizes the existing reports on the use of cannabis for headache, and examines the preclinical literature exploring the role of exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids to alter headache pathophysiology. Currently, there is not enough evidence from well-designed clinical trials to support the use of cannabis for headache, but there are sufficient anecdotal and preliminary results, as well as plausible neurobiological mechanisms, to warrant properly designed clinical trials. Such trials are needed to determine short- and long-term efficacy for specific headache types, compatibility with existing treatments, optimal administration practices, as well as potential risks.© Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.

N2  - Introduction: Cannabis has been historically classified as a hallucinogen. However, subjective cannabis effects do not typically include hallucinogen-like effects. Empirical reports of hallucinogen-like effects produced by cannabis in controlled settings, particularly among healthy research volunteers, are rare and have mostly occurred after administration of purified DELTA-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) rather than whole plant cannabis. Methods: The case of a healthy 30-year-old male who experienced auditory and visual hallucinations in a controlled laboratory study after inhaling vaporized cannabis that contained 25 mg THC (case dose) is presented. Ratings on the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS) following the case dose are compared with HRS ratings obtained from the participant after other doses of cannabis and with archival HRS data from laboratory studies involving acute doses of cannabis, psilocybin, dextromethorphan (DXM), and salvinorin A. Results: Scores on the Volition subscale of the HRS were greater for the case dose than for the maximum dose administered in any other comparison study. Scores on the Intensity and Perception subscales were greater for the case dose than for the maximum dose of cannabis, psilocybin, or salvinorin A. Scores on the Somaesthesia subscale were greater for the case dose than for the maximum dose of DXM, salvinorin A, or cannabis. Scores on the Affect and Cognition subscales for the case dose were significantly lower than for the maximum doses of psilocybin and DXM. Conclusion: Acute cannabis exposure in a healthy adult male resulted in self-reported hallucinations that rated high in magnitude on several subscales of the HRS. However, the hallucinatory experience in this case was qualitatively different than that typically experienced by participants receiving classic and atypical hallucinogens, suggesting that the hallucinatory effects of cannabis may have a unique pharmacological mechanism of action. This type of adverse event needs to be considered in the clinical use of cannabis.Copyright © Frederick S. Barrett et al. 2018.

N2  - Background: Conventional antidepressants are thought to produce their impact on clinical symptoms by increasing the central availability of biogenic amine neurotransmitters (the monoamine hypothesis of depres-sion). These drugs continue to be the primary medicines used in major depressive disorder. Although they have biological effects after acute dosing, full antidepressant response generally takes weeks of daily administration. Lack of rapid onset is a large limitation in antidepressant therapy (e.g., suicide, lack of medication compliance, difficulty switching medications). Methods: The present review of the literature discusses the preclinical and clinical findings on compounds that can produce immediate symptom relief. Results: These compounds include ketamine, scopolamine, and mechanistically-related drugs. Newer additions to the list of potential rapid-acting agents include antagonists of metabotropic (mGlu) 2/3 receptors, negative allosteric modulators of alpha5-containing GABAA receptors, and psychedelic compounds. An additional benefit of these compounds is that they have demonstrated large effect sizes and, importantly, demonstrated efficacy in patient's refractory to other treatments. A drawback of some of these compounds, to date, is finding ways to expand the duration of clinical efficacy. In addition, for some compounds, the side-effect profile requires management. A primary mechanism by which rapid effects might be produced is through the amplification of excitatory neuro-transmission through activation of AMPA receptors. The extracellular efflux of glutamate induced by these drugs has been documented and provides the hypothesized triggering mechanism for AMPA receptor amplification. Conclusion: The preclinical and clinical literature strongly suggests that rapid-acting antidepressants are the current focus of antidepressant drug discovery. Promising clinical findings exist for several compounds including ketamine and other NMDA receptor antagonists, scopolamine, and psilocybin. Two compounds are in late stage clinical development: GLYX-13 (Rapastinel) and eskekamine.Copyright © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.

T1  - The neuropharmacology of sleep paralysis hallucinations: serotonin 2A activation and a novel therapeutic drug
A1  - Jalal B. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Sleep paralysis is a state of involuntary immobility occurring at sleep onset or offset, often accompanied by uncanny "ghost-like" hallucinations and extreme fear reactions. I provide here a neuropharmacological account for these hallucinatory experiences by evoking the role of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR). Research has shown that 5-HT2AR activation can induce visual hallucinations, "mystical" subjective states, and out-of-body experiences (OBEs), and modulate fear circuits. Hallucinatory experiences triggered by serotonin-serotonergic ("pseudo") hallucinations, induced by hallucinogenic drugs-tend to be "dream-like" with the experiencer having insight ("meta-awareness") that he is hallucinating, unlike dopaminergic ("psychotic" and "life-like") hallucinations where such insight is lost. Indeed, hallucinatory experiences during sleep paralysis have the classic features of serotonergic hallucinations, and are strikingly similar to perceptual and subjective states induced by hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD] and psilocybin), i.e., they entail visual hallucinations, mystical experiences, OBEs, and extreme fear reactions. I propose a possible mechanism whereby serotonin could be functionally implicated in generating sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions through 5-HT2AR activity. Moreover, I speculate on the role of 5-HT2C receptors vis-a-vis anxiety and panic during sleep paralysis, and the orbitofrontal cortex-rich with 5-HT2A receptors-in influencing visual pathways during sleep paralysis, and, in effect, hallucinations. Finally, I propose, for the first time, a drug to target sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions, namely the selective 5-HT2AR inverse agonist, pimavanserin. This account implicates gene HTR2A on chromosome 13q as the underlying cause of sleep paralysis hallucinations and could be explored using positron emission tomography.Copyright © 2018, The Author(s).

N2  - Rationale: Recent clinical trials are reporting marked improvements in mental health outcomes with psychedelic drug-assisted psychotherapy. Objectives: Here, we report on safety and efficacy outcomes for up to 6 months in an open-label trial of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Methods: Twenty patients (six females) with (mostly) severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. Depressive symptoms were assessed from 1 week to 6 months post-treatment, with the self-rated QIDS-SR16 as the primary outcome measure. Results: Treatment was generally well tolerated. Relative to baseline, marked reductions in depressive symptoms were observed for the first 5 weeks post-treatment (Cohen's d = 2.2 at week 1 and 2.3 at week 5, both p < 0.001); nine and four patients met the criteria for response and remission at week 5. Results remained positive at 3 and 6 months (Cohen's d = 1.5 and 1.4, respectively, both p < 0.001). No patients sought conventional antidepressant treatment within 5 weeks of psilocybin. Reductions in depressive symptoms at 5 weeks were predicted by the quality of the acute psychedelic experience. Conclusions: Although limited conclusions can be drawn about treatment efficacy from open-label trials, tolerability was good, effect sizes large and symptom improvements appeared rapidly after just two psilocybin treatment sessions and remained significant 6 months post-treatment in a treatment-resistant cohort. Psilocybin represents a promising paradigm for unresponsive depression that warrants further research in double-blind randomised control trials.Copyright © 2017, The Author(s).

N2  - Rationale: Although psilocybin and dextromethorphan (DXM) are hallucinogens, they have different receptor mechanisms of action and have not been directly compared. Objective: This study compared subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects of psilocybin and dextromethorphan under conditions that minimized expectancy effects. Methods: Single, acute oral doses of psilocybin (10, 20, 30 mg/70 kg), DXM (400 mg/70 kg), and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Various subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects were assessed after drug administration. Results: High doses of both drugs produced similar increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength, with similar times to maximal effect and time-course. Psilocybin produced orderly dose-related increases on most participant-rated subjective measures previously shown sensitive to hallucinogens. DXM produced increases on most of these same measures. However, the high dose of psilocybin produced significantly greater and more diverse visual effects than DXM including greater movement and more frequent, brighter, distinctive, and complex (including textured and kaleidoscopic) images and visions. Compared to DXM, psilocybin also produced significantly greater mystical-type and psychologically insightful experiences and greater absorption in music. In contrast, DXM produced larger effects than psilocybin on measures of disembodiment, nausea/emesis, and light-headedness. Both drugs increased systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil dilation and decreased psychomotor performance and balance. Conclusions: Psilocybin and DXM produced similar profiles of subjective experiences, with psilocybin producing relatively greater visual, mystical-type, insightful, and musical experiences, and DXM producing greater disembodiment.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

N2  - Rationale: Recent studies have supported the safety and efficacy of psychedelic therapy for mood disorders and addiction. Music is considered an important component in the treatment model, but little empirical research has been done to examine the magnitude and nature of its therapeutic role. Objectives: The present study assessed the influence of music on the acute experience and clinical outcomes of psychedelic therapy. Methods: Semi-structured interviews inquired about the different ways in which music influenced the experience of 19 patients undergoing psychedelic therapy with psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was applied to the interview data to identify salient themes. In addition, ratings were given for each patient for the extent to which they expressed "liking," "resonance" (the music being experienced as "harmonious" with the emotional state of the listener), and "openness" (acceptance of the music-evoked experience). Results: Analyses of the interviews revealed that the music had both "welcome" and "unwelcome" influences on patients' subjective experiences. Welcome influences included the evocation of personally meaningful and therapeutically useful emotion and mental imagery, a sense of guidance, openness, and the promotion of calm and a sense of safety. Conversely, unwelcome influences included the evocation of unpleasant emotion and imagery, a sense of being misguided and resistance. Correlation analyses showed that patients' experience of the music was associated with the occurrence of "mystical experiences" and "insightfulness." Crucially, the nature of the music experience was significantly predictive of reductions in depression 1 week after psilocybin, whereas general drug intensity was not. Conclusions: This study indicates that music plays a central therapeutic function in psychedelic therapy.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

T1  - The 21st century psychedelic renaissance: heroic steps forward on the back of an elephant
A1  - Sessa B. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Given the plethora of new studies and published papers in the scientific press and the increasingly emerging presence of articles about positive psychedelic experiences appearing in the popular media, there is little doubt that we are in the midst of a Psychedelic Renaissance. The classical psychedelic drugs LSD and psilocybin and the entactogen MDMA are showing promise as tools to assist psychotherapy for a wide range of mental disorders, with multiple pilot studies demonstrating their safety and efficacy. In this article, the author describes how MDMA in particular has inherent characteristics that make it well suited for assisting trauma-focused psychotherapy in a population of patients who have experienced child abuse. But despite these advances, there remain many obstacles ahead of the widespread mainstream acceptance of psychedelic medicines. The author argues that the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 is one such obstacle. Other impediments include a prevailing attitude of pseudoscience and rigidity from within the non-scientific psychedelic community itself. Resolution of these conflicts must be sought if medicine and society are to see psychedelics gaining a place in mainstream culture and science.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

N2  - Rationale: Depressed patients robustly exhibit affective biases in emotional processing which are altered by SSRIs and predict clinical outcome. Objectives: The objective of this study is to investigate whether psilocybin, recently shown to rapidly improve mood in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), alters patients' emotional processing biases. Methods: Seventeen patients with treatment-resistant depression completed a dynamic emotional face recognition task at baseline and 1 month later after two doses of psilocybin with psychological support. Sixteen controls completed the emotional recognition task over the same time frame but did not receive psilocybin. Results: We found evidence for a group x time interaction on speed of emotion recognition (p = .035). At baseline, patients were slower at recognising facial emotions compared with controls (p < .001). After psilocybin, this difference was remediated (p = .208). Emotion recognition was faster at follow-up compared with baseline in patients (p = .004, d = .876) but not controls (p = .263, d = .302). In patients, this change was significantly correlated with a reduction in anhedonia over the same time period (r = .640, p = .010). Conclusions: Psilocybin with psychological support appears to improve processing of emotional faces in treatment-resistant depression, and this correlates with reduced anhedonia. Placebo-controlled studies are warranted to follow up these preliminary findings.Copyright © 2017, The Author(s).

N2  - Rationale: Disruption of auditory event-related evoked potentials (ERPs) P300 and mismatch negativity (MMN), electrophysiological markers of attentive and pre-attentive cognitive processing, is repeatedly described in psychosis and schizophrenia. Similar findings were observed in a glutamatergic model of psychosis, but the role of serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors in information processing is less clear. Objectives: We studied ERPs in a serotonergic model of psychosis, induced by psilocybin, a psychedelic with 5-HT2A/C agonistic properties, in healthy volunteers. Methods: Twenty subjects (10M/10F) were given 0.26 mg/kg of psilocybin orally in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design. ERPs (P300, MMN) were registered during the peak of intoxication. Correlations between measured electrophysiological variables and psilocin serum levels and neuropsychological effects were also analyzed. Results: Psilocybin induced robust psychedelic effects and psychotic-like symptoms, decreased P300 amplitude (p = 0.009) but did not affect the MMN. Psilocybin's disruptive effect on P300 correlated with the intensity of the psychedelic state, which was dependent on the psilocin serum levels. We also observed a decrease in N100 amplitude (p = 0.039) in the P300 paradigm and a negative correlation between P300 and MMN amplitude (p = 0.014). Conclusions: Even though pre-attentive cognition (MMN) was not affected, processing at the early perceptual level (N100) and in higher-order cognition (P300) was significantly disrupted by psilocybin. Our results have implications for the role of 5-HT2A receptors in altered information processing in psychosis and schizophrenia.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Objective: To explore whether psilocybin with psychological support modulates personality parameters in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Method: Twenty patients with moderate or severe, unipolar, TRD received oral psilocybin (10 and 25 mg, one week apart) in a supportive setting. Personality was assessed at baseline and at 3-month follow-up using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R), the subjective psilocybin experience with Altered State of Consciousness (ASC) scale, and depressive symptoms with QIDS-SR16. Results: Neuroticism scores significantly decreased while Extraversion increased following psilocybin therapy. These changes were in the direction of the normative NEO-PI-R data and were both predicted, in an exploratory analysis, by the degree of insightfulness experienced during the psilocybin session. Openness scores also significantly increased following psilocybin, whereas Conscientiousness showed trend-level increases, and Agreeableness did not change. Conclusion: Our observation of changes in personality measures after psilocybin therapy was mostly consistent with reports of personality change in relation to conventional antidepressant treatment, although the pronounced increases in Extraversion and Openness might constitute an effect more specific to psychedelic therapy. This needs further exploration in future controlled studies, as do the brain mechanisms of postpsychedelic personality change.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

N2  - Background: Tryptamines are a class of compounds including serotonin, psilocybin, and N,N-dimethyltryptamine with substituted monoamine groups. Fatalities related to tryptamines are associated with intense sympathomimetic effects and/or severe serotonin toxicity. Less is known about the pharmacokinetic properties and clinical manifestations of synthetic tryptamines such as N,N-dipropyltryptamine (DPT). We report a case of confirmed DPT use leading to brain death in a teenager. Case report: A 17-year-old boy was found down outside 12 h after he was reported missing. A friend reported both had insufflated "DPT." The patient was found shaking in apparent convulsions near a watery marsh. He was moved to solid ground, but when EMS providers arrived he was pulseless and apneic. Pupils were 5mm and reactive, extremities were cool, skin was cyanotic. GCS was 3; blood glucose was 300mg/dl. Naloxone (2mg IV) resulted in no response. He was intubated prehospital. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (30 min) and 4mg of epinephrine resulted in return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Post-ROSC vital signs included blood pressure 119/52mmHg, pulse 112 beats/min, and temperature of 35 degreeC. EKG revealed a QRS duration of 116 msec; 7 ampules (50 mEq/ampule) of bicarbonate were given with minimal response. On hospital arrival he made no purposeful movements without sedation. Initial labs were as follows: venous pH 7.26, serum bicarbonate 14 mEq/l, creatinine 1.86mg/dl, troponin I 0.213mcg/l, lactate 6.5mmol/l, and creatinine kinase 3310 IU/l (peak 16,020 IU/l). Brain imaging was concerning for global hypoxic injury; therapeutic hypothermia was performed. The following morning he developed hypertension, anisocoria, and non-reactive pupils. Cerebral edema was confirmed by brain imaging. Neurosurgery placed a ventriculostomy but intracranial pressures rose despite aggressive management with mannitol and hypertonic saline. He was subsequently declared brain dead on hospital day 3. His urine drug screen by mass spectrometry done by the medical examiner laboratory was negative for all basic and neutral drugs in the reference catalog. Drug paraphernalia from the scene was confiscated by law enforcement and tested positive only for DPT. Local media reported this product was purchased for $400 online and shipped from China. Case discussion: In the years preceding this case, 1-2 deaths per year due to tryptamines were reported to the National Poison Data System. Synthetic tryptamines are part of the epidemic of novel psychoactive substances sold online as "legal highs." This patient developed seizures, cardiopulmonary arrest, and evidence of early hypoxic-ischemic injury with multi-organ injury. It is unknown if seizures were due to anoxia or direct effects of DPT. Complete autopsy results were not available, however direct contact with law enforcement indicated this death was not attributable to drowning and was in fact due to direct drug intoxication. Conclusion: N,N-dipropyltryptamine (DPT) is a potentially lethal drug easily purchased online. Parents, law enforcement, and poison educators should continue to warn the adolescent community about the risk of so called "legal highs.".

N2  - Background/Objectives: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin containing mushrooms (PCM) are hallucinogenic substances commonly used for abuse purposes. LSD and PCM produce different euphoric effects and the types of users and social activities of users is likely different. The objective of this study was to compare additional substances used by patients who are abusing and misusing LSD plus one agent (LSD +1) or PCM plus one agent (PCM +1). Secondary objectives include comparing the rates of moderate and severe effects and highest level of medical care with LSD/PCM/LSD +1/PCM +1. Methods: This was a retrospective study of LSD and PCM exposures reported to the NPDS from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2016. Inclusion criteria for the primary outcome were patients >9 years of age, use of LSD or PCM coded as intentional-abuse or intentional-misuse and were either single substance or 2 substance (LSD +1, PCM +1) exposures. For the secondary outcome, patients followed to a known medical outcome were included and findings were compared to LSD only and PCM only. Drugs that are not known to be abused were combined as "other drugs," any opioid-containing product was coded as an opioid, and antipsychotics were coded as "other sedative." Data were analyzed by chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables Results: For the primary outcome, there were 1335 PCM +1 patients and 1392 LSD +1 patients. An additional 57 patients were using both. Mean age was 20.2 years and 78.9% male. The most frequent additional substances used for both groups were marijuana, ethanol, and hallucinogenic amphetamines. Patients using PCM were significantly more likely to be also using marijuana (38.7% PCM versus 24.7% LSD, p<.0001) or ethanol (22.8% PCM versus 14.1% LSD, p<.0001), while patients using LSD were more likely to be abusing hallucinogenic amphetamines (7.3% LSD versus 18.0% PCM, p<.0001) or any type of stimulant (8.0% LSD versus 4.2% PCM, p<.0001). For 4784 PCM, 2909 LSD, 1116 PCM +1 and 1166 LSD +1 patients followed to a known outcome, the rate of admission to critical care unit was lowest with PCM alone (7.4%) and was significantly higher for LSD alone (18.0%), LSD +1 (25.6%), and PCM +1 (13.8%); p<.0001 for each. The rate of moderate effect was similar for each group at 65.7% for PCM, 64.8% for LSD, 65.7% for LSD +1, and 65.5% for PCM +1; p>.05 for each. Rates of major effect were 2.2% for PCM, 6.5% for LSD, 9% for LSD +1 and 4% for PSM +1. Compared with PCM, rates of major effect were significantly higher for each other group; p<.001 for each. Conclusion: Abuse or misuse of LSD was more commonly associated with concurrent use of stimulant agents whereas use of PCM was more commonly associated with depressants. Compared with psilocybin alone, addition of second substances was associated with more severe medical outcomes and need for higher levels of care. The two substances are pharmacologically different, and use may be associated with different social groups. This may be reflected in the additional substances used.

T1  - Use of psychedelics and antagonists in psychiatric treatment: Pros and cons
T3  - 2nd World Congress of World Association on Dual Disorder, WADD 2018. Italy.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Ketamine is known to block N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors thereby affecting the action of glutamate, a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Several recent trials indicate low-dose ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects and also been reported to alleviate depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant depression. However, uncertainty remains in several areas: dose response, consistency across patient groups, effects on suicidality, and possible biases arising from crossover trials. Psychedelics (serotonin 2A receptor 5-HT2AR) agonist such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and the DMT containing admixture ayahuasca, have shown promise in treating a range of psychological disorders for which currently available treatments are often insufficient, such as mood, substance use disorders, and anxiety disorders. Problem is that studies have mostly been conducted in small, relatively homogeneous samples, limiting the generalizability of their findings. We will present pros and cons of use of psychedelics and ketamine in different psychiatric treatments.

T1  - Lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin for the management of patients with persistent pain: A potential role?
A1  - Whelan A.
A1  - Johnson M.I. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Recently, there has been interest in lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin for depression, anxiety and fear of death in terminal illness. The aim of this review is to discuss the potential use of LSD and psilocybin for patients with persistent pain. LSD and psilocybin are 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists and may interact with nociceptive and antinociceptive processing. Tentative evidence from a systematic review suggests that LSD (7 studies, 323 participants) and psilocybin (3 studies, 92 participants) may be beneficial for depression and anxiety associated with distress in life-threatening diseases. LSD and psilocybin are generally safe if administered by a healthcare professional, although further investigations are needed to assess their utility for patients with persistent pain, especially associated with terminal illness.Copyright © 2018 Future Medicine Ltd.

T1  - Out of the box: A psychedelic model to study the creative mind
A1  - Kuypers K.P.C. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Our creativity is challenged daily when facing new situations asking for novel solutions. Creativity, a multicomponent construct includes flexible divergent and rigid convergent thinking. Psychedelic drugs like psilocybin can enhance creativity and affect state of mind (mood, empathy, openness). Of note, flexible thinking is disturbed in psychopathological conditions like anxiety disorders and depression and preliminary findings have shown psychedelics to be efficacious in the treatment of those conditions. The question how psychedelics induce this state of enhanced flexible thinking remains to be answered and investigating the neurobiology underlying this phenomenon will not only help in understanding why psychedelics are of use in the therapeutic setting but also in other settings where flexible thinking is challenged. A model including neuronal networks, neurotransmitters and personal factors playing a role in this process will be proposed which can be put to the test by means of placebo-controlled pharmaco-imaging studies in healthy volunteers.Copyright © 2018 The Author

N2  - Though relatively obscure, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an important molecule in psychopharmacology as it is the archetype for all indole-containing serotonergic psychedelics. Its structure can be found embedded within those of better-known molecules such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin. Unlike the latter two compounds, DMT is ubiquitous, being produced by a wide variety of plant and animal species. It is one of the principal psychoactive components of ayahuasca, a tisane made from various plant sources that has been used for centuries. Furthermore, DMT is one of the few psychedelic compounds produced endogenously by mammals, and its biological function in human physiology remains a mystery. In this review, we cover the synthesis of DMT as well as its pharmacology, metabolism, adverse effects, and potential use in medicine. Finally, we discuss the history of DMT in chemical neuroscience and why this underappreciated molecule is so important to the field of psychedelic science.© Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

N2  - Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is one of the most potent psychoactive agents known, producing dramatic alterations of consciousness after submilligram (>=20 mug) oral doses. Following the accidental discovery of its potent psychoactive effects in 1943, it was supplied by Sandoz Laboratories as an experimental drug that might be useful as an adjunct for psychotherapy, or to give psychiatrists insight into the mental processes in their patients. The finding of serotonin in the mammalian brain in 1953, and its structural resemblance to LSD, quickly led to ideas that serotonin in the brain might be involved in mental disorders, initiating rapid research interest in the neurochemistry of serotonin. LSD proved to be physiologically very safe and nonaddictive, with a very low incidence of adverse events when used in controlled experiments. Widely hailed by psychiatry as a breakthrough in the 1950s and early 1960s, clinical research with LSD ended by about 1970, when it was formally placed into Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 following its growing popularity as a recreational drug. Within the past 5 years, clinical research with LSD has begun in Europe, but there has been none in the United States. LSD is proving to be a powerful tool to help understand brain dynamics when combined with modern brain imaging methods. It remains to be seen whether therapeutic value for LSD can be confirmed in controlled clinical trials, but promising results have been obtained in small pilot trials of depression, anxiety, and addictions using psilocybin, a related psychedelic molecule.© Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

N2  - Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with an agonist activity at 5-HT2A/C and 5-HT1A receptors. It is used as a research tool to study neurobiology of psychosis as well as it is gaining attention as a possible therapeutic tool to treat depression, anxiety, and addiction. It has been already shown that psychedelics, including psilocybin, acutely induce desynchronization of the alpha activity occipitally and disconnection during the peak of intoxication. However, understanding of the dynamics of these changes has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, the current study focuses on the behavioral and EEG effects of psilocybin at several time points during the 6 hours of intoxication. Twenty volunteers with a balanced gender ratio (10 male/10 female) entered the study. Each participant underwent 2 sessions with oral psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) or a placebo in a double-blinded crossover design. In most of the subjects, psilocybin induced fully psychedelic effects as measured by psychometric scales, the effects peaked between 1 and 2 hours after administration. Decreased current density of the alpha band in the occipital region, which diminished over time was the most robust finding. The connectivity analyses showed biphasic effect on overall connectivity indicating two different connectivity states at the peak of intoxication and 6 hours after the ingestion. Results will be discussed in relation to the potential therapeutic effects of psilocybin.

N2  - The serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin and its active metabolite psilocin nowadays receive a lot of attention as a research tool for modeling psychosis. The aim of the study was to assess psilocin-induced changes in quantitative EEG (QEEG) in rats in order to explore the role of different serotonergic receptors in psilocin action. EEG was recorded in freely moving rats after implantation of 12 active electrodes onto the surface of the cortex. EEG power spectra (local synchronization) and coherence (long projections) were analyzed comparing the drugs' effect in time to the baseline record. Only EEG traces corresponding to behavioral inactivity were included in the analysis. We used psilocin, selective 5HT receptor antagonists, and antipsychotics. Psilocin generally decreased both EEG absolute spectral power and EEG coherences. The changes in spectral power induced by psilocin were normalized partially by all substances used, mainly in the lower frequency bands. However, only 5HT1A and 5HT2A antagonists partially normalized the psilocin-induced decrease of EEG coherences. The specific QEEG pattern of each substance and the temporal dynamics of QEEG changes will be presented. Psilocininduced changes in QEEG in rats are very similar to our human data with psilocybin and are in accordance with the concept of psychosis as a disconnection syndrome. All the specific 5HT antagonists and both antipsychotic drugs specifically affected the EEG spectral power induced by psilocin. Surprisingly, only 5HT1A and 5HT2A antagonists were able to partially reverse psilocin-induced disconnection.

N2  - Introduction. The presented method deals with changes in human and rat brain functional EEG connectivity conditioned by administration of psilocin (in rats) and psilocybin (in human). The searched similarities between rats and human models are difficult to be found when preserving low-level information, for example, all combinations of connections within all frequency bands in all epochs. Here, we show that unique functional brain clusters coherently modulated by a particular substance are embedded in multidimensional space of coherences and can be extracted by appropriate dimensional reduction technique. Methods. EEG recordings were acquired with respect to pharmacokinetics of psilocin (in rats) and psilocybin (in humans). Weighted phase lag indices (WPLI) were calculated at 4 time epochs after administration. WPLI time differences between epochs were calculated and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) reduced data dimension. A number of clusters was determined by silhouette clustering index and similarities were labeled by k-means algorithm. Surrogate series preserving power spectrum of instantaneous angular frequency in EEG data were generated to statistically address the clustering properties. Results. Preliminary results of psilocin in rats clearly showed 4 clusters of connections. Three clusters were localized intrahemispherically and only one connected both hemispheres together. In humans, the psilocybin resulted in 2 symmetric clusters distributed mostly intrahemispherically. Conclusion. Developed method is capable to extract individual (rats or human) and common (rats and human) long-term connectivity dynamics induced by drug administration.

N2  - Ingestion of wild and potentially toxic mushrooms is common in the United States and many other parts of the world. US poison centers have been logging cases of mushroom exposure in The National Poison Data System (NPDS) annual publications for over 30 years. This study compiles and analyzes US mushroom exposures as reported by the NPDS from 1999 to 2016. Over the last 18 years, 133 700 cases (7428/year) of mushroom exposure, mostly by ingestion, have been reported. Cases are most frequently unintentional (83%, P < 0.001); cause no or only minor harm (86%, P < 0.001); and in children <6 years old (62%, P < 0.001). Approximately 704 (39/year) exposures have resulted in major harm. Fifty-two (2.9/year) fatalities have been reported, mostly from cyclopeptide (68-89%)-producing mushrooms ingested by older adults unintentionally. The vast majority of reported ingestions resulted in no or minor harm, although some groups of mushroom toxins or irritants, such as cyclopepides, ibotenic acid, and monomethylhydrazine, have been deadly. Misidentification of edible mushroom species appears to be the most common cause and may be preventable through education.

N2  - The West African iboga plant has been used for centuries by the Bwiti and Mbiri tribes to induce hallucinations during religious ceremonies. Ibogaine, the principal alkaloid responsible for iboga's psychedelic properties, was isolated and sold as an antidepressant in France for decades before its adverse effects precipitated its removal from the market. An ibogaine resurgence in the 1960s was driven by U.S. heroin addicts who claimed that ibogaine cured their opiate addictions. Behavioral pharmacologic studies in animal models provided evidence that ibogaine could blunt self-administration of not only opiates but cocaine, amphetamines, and nicotine. Ibogaine displays moderate-to-weak affinities for a wide spectrum of receptor and transporter proteins; recent work suggests that its actions at nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes may underlie its reputed antiopiate effects. At micromolar levels, ibogaine is neurotoxic and cardiotoxic and has been linked to several deaths by cardiac arrest. Structure-activity studies led to the isolation of the ibogaine analog 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), an alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptor modulator that retains ibogaine's anticraving properties with few or no adverse effects. Clinical trials of 18-MC treatment of nicotine addiction are pending. Ibogaine analogs may also hold promise for treating anxiety and depression via the "psychedelic-assisted therapy" approach that employs hallucinogens including psilocybin and methylenedioxymethamphetamine ("ecstasy").

N2  - Psilocybin is found in a family of mushrooms commonly known as "magic mushrooms" that have been used throughout history to induce hallucinations. In the late 1950s Albert Hofmann, of Sandoz Laboratories, identified and synthesized the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and psilocin which are found in psilocybe mushrooms. Psilocybin was marketed by Sandoz as Indocybin for basic psychopharmacological and therapeutic clinical research. Psilocybin saw a rapid rise in popularity during the 1960s and was classed as a Schedule I drug in 1970. This led to a significant decrease in psilocybin research. Recently, however, preliminary studies with psilocybin have shown promise as potential for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol addiction, tobacco addiction, and major depressive disorder, and the treatment of depression in terminally ill cancer patients. This review describes in detail the synthesis, metabolism, pharmacology, adverse drug reactions, and importance of psilocybin to neuroscience in the past and present.

N2  - In the past decade, an increasing number of clinical trials are reporting evidence that psychedelics or serotonergic hallucinogens (such as lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and ayahuasca/dimethyltryptamine) could be effective in the treatment of mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. The mechanisms responsible for these effects are not fully understood but seem to involve changes in bran dynamics in areas rich in serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors and in personality. In the present text, we present a brief and critical overview of the current research in this field, pointing out both promises and limitations of these studies.

N2  - The West African iboga plant has been used for centuries by the Bwiti and Mbiri tribes to induce hallucinations during religious ceremonies. Ibogaine, the principal alkaloid responsible for iboga's psychedelic properties, was isolated and sold as an antidepressant in France for decades before its adverse effects precipitated its removal from the market. An ibogaine resurgence in the 1960s was driven by U.S. heroin addicts who claimed that ibogaine cured their opiate addictions. Behavioral pharmacologic studies in animal models provided evidence that ibogaine could blunt self-administration of not only opiates but cocaine, amphetamines, and nicotine. Ibogaine displays moderate-to-weak affinities for a wide spectrum of receptor and transporter proteins; recent work suggests that its actions at nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes may underlie its reputed antiopiate effects. At micromolar levels, ibogaine is neurotoxic and cardiotoxic and has been linked to several deaths by cardiac arrest. Structure-activity studies led to the isolation of the ibogaine analog 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), an alpha3beta4 nicotinic receptor modulator that retains ibogaine's anticraving properties with few or no adverse effects. Clinical trials of 18-MC treatment of nicotine addiction are pending. Ibogaine analogs may also hold promise for treating anxiety and depression via the "psychedelic-assisted therapy" approach that employs hallucinogens including psilocybin and methylenedioxymethamphetamine ("ecstasy").Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.

N2  - Psilocybe mushrooms are best known for their l-tryptophan-derived psychotropic alkaloid psilocybin. Dimethylation of norbaeocystin, the precursor of psilocybin, by the enzyme PsiM is a critical step during the biosynthesis of psilocybin. However, the "magic" mushroom Psilocybe serbica also mono- and dimethylates l-tryptophan, which is incompatible with the specificity of PsiM. Here, a second methyltransferase, TrpM, was identified and functionally characterized. Mono- and dimethylation activity on l-tryptophan was reconstituted in vitro, whereas tryptamine was rejected as a substrate. Therefore, we describe a second l-tryptophan-dependent pathway in Psilocybe that is not part of the biosynthesis of psilocybin. TrpM is unrelated to PsiM but originates from a retained ancient duplication event of a portion of the egtDB gene that encodes an ergothioneine biosynthesis enzyme. During mushroom evolution, this duplicated gene was widely lost but re-evolved sporadically and independently in various genera. We propose a new secondary metabolism evolvability mechanism, in which weakly selected genes are retained through preservation in a widely distributed, conserved pathway.Copyright © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

N2  - Objectives: Microdosing (MD) with hallucinogens is the act of taking a subperceptual dose of a psychedelic substance, such as lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, or mescaline. Individuals engaged in MD intend to enhance mood, cognitive function, perception, productivity, and/or creativity. Media reports have shown recent interest in MD, particularly among tech industry workers and college students, and suggested that some individuals have turned to MD as an alternative to engaging in nonmedical use of prescription stimulants (NPS). However, no studies have examined the frequency of MD among college students, nor have they examined whether MD is associated with other drug use such as NPS. The present study examined frequency of MD among a college student screening sample group and whether MD was associated with other drug use. Mean differences in MD frequency among individuals engaged in NPS versus individuals not were evaluated. We further explored the frequency of negative consequences associated with MD. Methods: Participants comprised 2868 college students who screened for use of alcohol, marijuana, NPS, hallucinogens, and MD for a larger intervention study targeting NPS. Data assessing negative consequences associated with MD were examined for a subset of participants (n = 77) who reported past-year MD and NPS. Results: Among screened participants, 14% used hallucinogens, and of them, 72% reported MD. MD was positively associated with NPS, alcohol, and marijuana use. Participants who engaged in past-year NPS reported a mean lifetime MD frequency of 2.14 compared with 0.20 occasions among those who had not engaged in past-year NPS (t = -7.11, p < 0.001). Among participants who engaged in past-year MD, 68.8% experienced at least one negative consequence with an average of 2.74 (SD = 2.98) consequences in the past year. The most common consequences were experiencing hallucinations (44.2%), increased heart rate (34.2%), and feeling anxious (35.1%). Conclusions: These data suggest that MD is becoming increasingly prevalent among college students, with the majority of those engaging in MD experiencing negative consequences. MD was also associated with other substance use, particularly NPS. Given the rates of MD in this study, along with recent media attention, more research is needed to understand this behavior as a target for prevention and brief intervention.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Classic psychedelics (serotonin 2A receptor agonists) and dissociative hallucinogens (NMDA receptor antagonists), though differing in pharmacology, may share neuropsychological effects. These drugs, however, have undergone limited direct comparison. This report presents data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subjects study comparing the neuropsychological effects of multiple doses of the classic psychedelic psilocybin with the effects of a single high dose of the dissociative hallucinogen dextromethorphan (DXM)., METHODS: Twenty hallucinogen users (11 females) completed neurocognitive assessments during five blinded drug administration sessions (10, 20, and 30 mg/70 kg psilocybin; 400 mg/70 kg DXM; and placebo) in which participants and study staff were informed that a large range of possible drug conditions may have been administered., RESULTS: Global cognitive impairment, assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination during peak drug effects, was not observed with psilocybin or DXM. Orderly and dose-dependent effects of psilocybin were observed on psychomotor performance, working memory, episodic memory, associative learning, and visual perception. Effects of DXM on psychomotor performance, visual perception, and associative learning were in the range of effects of a moderate to high dose (20 to 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin., CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study of the dose effects of psilocybin on a large battery of neurocognitive assessments. Evidence of delirium or global cognitive impairment was not observed with either psilocybin or DXM. Psilocybin had greater effects than DXM on working memory. DXM had greater effects than all psilocybin doses on balance, episodic memory, response inhibition, and executive control.

N2  - Association between substance use and excessive play of online games exists both in theory and research. However, no study to date examined playing online games under the influence of licit and illicit drugs. Methods: We questioned a convenient online sample of 3,952 Czech online gamers on their experiences and motives of using caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, psychoactive pharmaceuticals, and illicit drugs while playing massive multiplayer online games (MMOGs). Results: The results showed low prevalence of illicit drug use while playing online games. Substance use was positively associated with intensity of gaming and both addiction and engagement; psychoactive substances with stimulating effect were linked to higher engagement and gaming intensity, whereas use of sedatives was associated with higher addiction score. Substance use varied slightly with the preference of game genre. Discussion: Drug use while playing appears as behavior, which is mostly not related to gaming - it concerns mostly caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, or cannabis. For some users, however, drug use was fueled by motivations toward improving their cognitive enhancement and gaming performance.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s)

N2  - The classic serotonergic hallucinogens, or psychedelics, have the ability to profoundly alter perception and behavior. These can include visual distortions, hallucinations, detachment from reality, and mystical experiences. Some psychedelics, like LSD, are able to produce these effects with remarkably low doses of drug. Others, like psilocybin, have recently been demonstrated to have significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and addiction that persist for at least several months after only a single therapeutic session. How does this occur? Much work has recently been published from imaging studies showing that psychedelics alter brain network connectivity. They facilitate a disintegration of the default mode network, producing a hyperconnectivity between brain regions that allow centers that do not normally communicate with each other to do so. The immediate and acute effects on both behaviors and network connectivity are likely mediated by effector pathways downstream of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation. These acute molecular processes also influence gene expression changes, which likely influence synaptic plasticity and facilitate more long-term changes in brain neurochemistry ultimately underlying the therapeutic efficacy of a single administration to achieve long-lasting effects. In this review, we summarize what is currently known about the molecular genetic responses to psychedelics within the brain and discuss how gene expression changes may contribute to altered cellular physiology and behaviors.Copyright © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.

N2  - This chapter begins with a brief review of descriptions and definitions of mystical-type experiences and the historical connection between classic hallucinogens and mystical experiences. The chapter then explores the empirical literature on experiences with classic hallucinogens in which claims about mystical or religious experiences have been made. A psychometrically validated questionnaire is described for the reliable measurement of mystical-type experiences occasioned by classic hallucinogens. Controlled laboratory studies show that under double-blind conditions that provide significant controls for expectancy bias, psilocybin can occasion complete mystical experiences in the majority of people studied. These effects are dose-dependent, specific to psilocybin compared to placebo or a psychoactive control substance, and have enduring impact on the moods, attitudes, and behaviors of participants as assessed by self-report of participants and ratings by community observers. Other studies suggest that enduring personal meaning in healthy volunteers and therapeutic outcomes in patients, including reduction and cessation of substance abuse behaviors and reduction of anxiety and depression in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis, are related to the occurrence of mystical experiences during drug sessions. The final sections of the chapter draw parallels in human neuroscience research between the neural bases of experiences with classic hallucinogens and the neural bases of meditative practices for which claims of mystical-type experience are sometimes made. From these parallels, a functional neural model of mystical experience is proposed, based on changes in the default mode network of the brain that have been observed after the administration of classic hallucinogens and during meditation practices for which mystical-type claims have been made.Copyright © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.

N2  - Because of the ethical and regulatory hurdles associated with human studies, much of what is known about the psychopharmacology of hallucinogens has been derived from animal models. However, developing reliable animal models has proven to be a challenging task due to the complexity and variability of hallucinogen effects in humans. This chapter focuses on three animal models that are frequently used to test the effects of hallucinogens on unconditioned behavior: head twitch response (HTR), prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI), and exploratory behavior. The HTR has demonstrated considerable utility in the neurochemical actions of hallucinogens. However, the latter two models have clearer conceptual bridges to human phenomenology. Consistent with the known mechanism of action of hallucinogens in humans, the behavioral effects of hallucinogens in rodents are mediated primarily by activation of 5-HT2A receptors. There is evidence, however, that other receptors may play secondary roles. The structure-activity relationships (SAR) of hallucinogens are reviewed in relation to each model, with a focus on the HTR in rats and mice.Copyright © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.

N2  - This chapter reviews what is known about the therapeutic uses of the serotonergic or classic hallucinogens, i.e., psychoactive drugs such as LSD and psilocybin that exert their effects primarily through agonist activity at serotonin 2A (5HT2A) receptors. Following a review of the history of human use and scientific study of these drugs, the data from clinical research are summarized, including extensive work on the use of classic hallucinogens in the treatment of alcoholism and other addictions, studies of the use of LSD and psilocybin to relieve distress concerning death, particularly in patients with advanced or terminal cancer, and more limited data concerning the use of classic hallucinogens to treat mood and anxiety disorders. A survey of possible mechanisms of clinically relevant effects is provided. The well-established safety of classic hallucinogens is reviewed. To provide a clinical perspective, case summaries are provided of two individuals who received treatment in recent controlled trials of psilocybin: one being treated for alcoholism, the other suffering from anxiety and depression related to fear of death due to a cancer diagnosis. Although promising early phase research conducted from the 1950s through the early 1970s was discontinued before firm conclusions could be reached concerning the efficacy of any of the classic hallucinogens for any clinical condition, the research that was conducted in that era strongly suggests that classic hallucinogens have clinically relevant effects, particularly in the case of LSD treatment of alcoholism. In the past decade, clinical trials have resumed investigating the effects of classic hallucinogens in the treatment of existential distress in the face of cancer, and in the treatment of addictions including alcoholism and nicotine addiction. The studies that have been completed to date are not sufficient to establish efficacy, but the outcomes have been very encouraging, and larger trials, up to and including phase 3, are now underway or being planned. Although research has elucidated many of the acute neurobiological and psychological effects of classic hallucinogens on humans, animals, and in vitro systems, the mechanisms of clinically relevant persisting effects remain poorly understood.Copyright © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.

N2  - Serotonergic hallucinogens, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), are famous for their capacity to temporally and profoundly alter an individual's visual experiences. These visual alterations show consistent attributes despite large inter- and intra-individual variances. Many reports document a common perception of colors as more saturated, with increased brightness and contrast in the environment ("Visual Intensifications"). Environmental objects might be altered in size ("Visual illusions") or take on a modified and special meaning for the subject ("Altered self-reference"). Subjects may perceive light flashes or geometrical figures containing recurrent patterns ("Elementary imagery and hallucinations") influenced by auditory stimuli ("Audiovisual synesthesia"), or they may envision images of people, animals, or landscapes ("Complex imagery and hallucinations") without any physical stimuli supporting their percepts. This wide assortment of visual phenomena suggests that one single neuropsychopharmacological mechanism is unlikely to explain such vast phenomenological diversity. Starting with mechanisms that act at the cellular level, the key role of 5-HT2A receptor activation and the subsequent increased cortical excitation will be considered. Next, it will be shown that area specific anatomical and dynamical features link increased excitation to the specific visual contents of hallucinations. The decrease of alpha oscillations by hallucinogens will then be introduced as a systemic mechanism for amplifying internal-driven excitation that overwhelms stimulus-induced excitations. Finally, the hallucinogen-induced parallel decrease of the N170 visual evoked potential and increased medial P1 potential will be discussed as key mechanisms for inducing a dysbalance between global integration and early visual gain that may explain several hallucinogen-induced visual experiences, including visual hallucinations, illusions, and intensifications.Copyright © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.

N2  - Classic serotonergic hallucinogens or psychedelics produce an altered states of consciousness (ASC) that is characterized by profound alterations in sensory perception, mood, thought including the perception of reality, and the sense of self. Over the past years, there has been considerable progress in the search for invariant and common features of psychedelic states. In the first part of this review, we outline contemporary approaches to characterize the structure of ASCs by means of three primary etiology-independent dimensions including oceanic boundlessness, anxious ego-dissolution, and visionary restructuralization as well as by 11 lower-order factors, all of which can be reliably measured by the altered state of consciousness questionnaire (APZ-OAV). The second part sheds light on the dynamic nature of psychedelic experiences. Frequently, psychedelic subjects progress through different stages over time and levels of changes along a perception-hallucination continuum of increasing arousal and ego-dissolution. We then review in detail the acute effects of psychedelics on sensory perception, emotion, cognition, creativity, and time perception along with possible neural mechanisms underlying them. The next part of this review outlines the influence of non-pharmacological factors (predictors) on the acute psychedelic experience, such as demographics, genetics, personality, mood, and setting, and also discusses some long-term effects succeeding the acute experience. The last part presents some recent concepts and models attempting to understand different facets of psychedelic states of consciousness from a neuroscientific perspective.Copyright © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.

N2  - The neuropsychological effects of naturally occurring psychoactive chemicals have been recognized for millennia. Hallucinogens, which include naturally occurring chemicals such as mescaline and psilocybin, as well as synthetic compounds, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), induce profound alterations of human consciousness, emotion, and cognition. The discovery of the hallucinogenic effects of LSD and the observations that LSD and the endogenous ligand serotonin share chemical and pharmacological profiles led to the suggestion that biogenic amines like serotonin were involved in the psychosis of mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Although they bind other G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) subtypes, studies indicate that several effects of hallucinogens involve agonist activity at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. In this chapter, we review recent advances in understanding hallucinogen drug action through characterization of structure, neuroanatomical location, and function of the 5-HT2A receptor.Copyright © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.

N2  - Introduction: Mood, anxiety, and substance-use disorders are among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in the population. Although several pharmacological treatments are available, they are not effective for a significant proportion of patients and are associated with several adverse reactions. Therefore, new treatments should be explored. Recent studies suggest that serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics including ayahuasca, psilocybin, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) have anxiolytic, antidepressive, and antiaddictive effects. Areas Covered: A systematic review of systematic reviews assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelic was performed using the PubMed data base until 11 April 2018. Systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis were analyzed, but only reviews that described at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT) were included. Expert Commentary: Psilocybin and LSD reduced anxiety and depression in cancer patients and symptoms of alcohol and tobacco dependence, and ayahuasca reduced depression symptoms in treatment-resistant depression. Although the results are promising, several studies were open label, and only few were RCTs, and most had small sample sizes and a short duration. Single or few doses of these drugs seem to be well tolerated, but long-term studies are lacking. New RCTs with bigger samples and longer duration are needed to replicate these findings.Copyright © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - One of the objectives of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (https://abcdstudy.org/) is to establish a national longitudinal cohort of 9 and 10 year olds that will be followed for 10 years in order to prospectively study the risk and protective factors influencing substance use and its consequences, examine the impact of substance use on neurocognitive, health and psychosocial outcomes, and to understand the relationship between substance use and psychopathology. This article provides an overview of the ABCD Study Substance Use Workgroup, provides the goals for the workgroup, rationale for the substance use battery, and includes details on the substance use module methods and measurement tools used during baseline, 6-month and 1-year follow-up assessment time-points. Prospective, longitudinal assessment of these substance use domains over a period of ten years in a nationwide sample of youth presents an unprecedented opportunity to further understand the timing and interactive relationships between substance use and neurocognitive, health, and psychopathology outcomes in youth living in the United States.Copyright © 2018 The Authors

N2  - In nature, there are >200 species of fungi with hallucinogenic properties. These fungi are classified as Psilocybe, Gymnopilus, and Panaeolus which contain active principles with hallucinogenic properties such as ibotenic acid, psilocybin, psilocin, or baeocystin. In Chile, fungi seizures are mainly of mature specimens or spores. However, clandestine laboratories have been found that process fungus samples at the mycelium stage. In this transient stage of growth (mycelium), traditional taxonomic identification is not feasible, making it necessary to develop a new method of study. Currently, DNA analysis is the only reliable method that can be used as an identification tool for the purposes of supporting evidence, due to the high variability of DNA between species. One way to identify the species of a distinctive DNA fragment is to study PCR products analyzed by real time PCR and sequencing. One of the most popular sequencing methods of forensic interest at the generic and intra-generic levels in plants is internal transcribed spacer (ITS). With real time PCR it is possible to distinguish PCR products by differential analysis of their melting temperature (Tm) curves. This paper describes morphological, chemical, and genetic analysis of mycelia of psychedelic fungi collected from a clandestine laboratory. The fungus species were identified using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mass spectrometry, HRM analysis, and ITS sequencing. The sporological studies showed a generally smooth surface and oval shape, with maximum length 10.1 mum and width 6.4 mum. The alkaloid Psilocyn was identified by mass spectrometry, while HRM analysis and ITS sequencing identified the species as Psilocybe cubensis. A genetic match was confirmed between the HRM curves obtained from the mycelia (evidence) and biological tissue extracted from the fruiting bodies. Mycelia recovered from the evidence and fruiting bodies (control) were genetically indistinguishable.Copyright © 2018 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences

N2  - Background: Natural speech analytics has seen some improvements over recent years, and this has opened a window for objective and quantitative diagnosis in psychiatry. Here, we used a machine learning algorithm applied to natural speech to ask whether language properties measured before psilocybin for treatment-resistant can predict for which patients it will be effective and for which it will not. Methods: A baseline autobiographical memory interview was conducted and transcribed. Patients with treatment-resistant depression received 2 doses of psilocybin, 10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart. Psychological support was provided before, during and after all dosing sessions. Quantitative speech measures were applied to the interview data from 17 patients and 18 untreated age-matched healthy control subjects. A machine learning algorithm was used to classify between controls and patients and predict treatment response. Results: Speech analytics and machine learning successfully differentiated depressed patients from healthy controls and identified treatment responders from non-responders with a significant level of 85% of accuracy (75% precision). Conclusions: Automatic natural language analysis was used to predict effective response to treatment with psilocybin, suggesting that these tools offer a highly cost-effective facility for screening individuals for treatment suitability and sensitivity. Limitations: The sample size was small and replication is required to strengthen inferences on these results.Copyright © 2018

N2  - Background: Hallucinogenic compounds such as psilocybin have reemerged as promising adjunctive treatments for alcohol use disorder. A recent open-label study of psilocybin with 12 weeks of psychosocial treatment for alcohol use disorder showed a significant acute reduction in the percentage of heavy drinking days, post-psilocybin administration for 36 weeks (Bogenschutz, 2015). Furthermore, the study showed that psilocybin-assisted treatment was safe, feasible, and tolerable. The methods and outcomes of that study were foundational in the design of this current investigation which is an ongoing double-blind active controlled clinical trial of psilocybin-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder (target enrollment, n = 180). Methods: Patients with alcohol use disorder were assigned to either receive orally administered psilocybin or diphenhydramine in two or three sessions in addition to Motivational Enhancement and Taking Action (META) therapy and therapy sessions devoted to preparation for and debriefing from the psilocybin sessions. Total treatment course was 42 weeks. Three patients who completed treatment in the trial were selected to represent the variety of experiences and outcomes observed, not as evidence of efficacy. Treatment assignment has not been un-blinded. Results: All three patients had a reduction in heavy drinking behavior. Two of the three patients were abstinent by the end of the trial. One of the three patients declined medication after his first session. Experiences were intense and memorable in ways that were unique to each patient. Conclusions: Although we do not know if psilocybin played a role in any of the study patients' treatment, the treatment course in its entirety was a memorable experience that appeared to have a positive impact on change in drinking behavior. These outcomes provide us with valuable information about the processes through which patients may or may not benefit from this type of treatment. Summary: This study examined psilocybin as a potential adjunctive therapy for patients with alcohol use disorder. Three patients from our ongoing double-blind activecontrolled clinical trial were selected to represent the variety of experiences and outcomes observed, not as evidence of efficacy. Although we do not know if psilocybin played a role in any of the study patients' treatment, the treatment course in its entirety was a memorable experience that appeared to have a positive impact on change in drinking behavior. These outcomes provide us with valuable information about the processes through which patients may or may not benefit from this type of treatment. This study has important implications for the future developments of treatment for alcohol use disorder as it may provide another accessible means of therapy for an incredible complex disease process.

N2  - Mushroom poisoning is one of the most common acute events. From an epidemiological viewpoint, accidental fungal poisoning occurs frequently in the Slovak Republic, especially during the main growing season of mushrooms in the summer and autumn. Intoxication is divided into several stages with typical symptoms. Several types of syndromes develop according to the type of fungus, the mycotoxins it contains, and the symptoms.These include gastroenterodyspeptic, muscarinic, psilocybin (psychotropic), mycoathropin-neurotoxic, gyromitrin-hepatotoxic, phaloid-hepatorenal, antabus, and orelanin-nephrotoxic syndromes.The fungus should be correctly identified in cases of mushroom poisoning. However, this is not possible in most cases for several reasons. The patient or doctor often lacks sufficient knowledge or theoretical and practical experience of recognizing mushroom species. Clinical pharmacologists and toxicologists can identify mushrooms based on their microscopic and macroscopic characteristics. The type of mushroom is unknown in 95% cases of mushroom poisoning. Amanita phalloides is one of the most poisonous mushrooms and is the cause of the majority of human deaths due to mushroom poisoning worldwide. The liver is the main target organ of toxicity, but other organs, especially the kidneys, are also affected. Intoxication symptoms usually appear after a latent period and may include gastrointestinal disorders followed by jaundice, seizures, and coma, culminating in death. Therapy consists of supportive measures, gastric decontamination, drug therapy, and ultimately liver transplantation if the clinical condition worsens. If necessary, the National Toxic Information Centre in Bratislava or other centers in neighboring countries can be contacted. We present a case report of Amanita phalloides poisoning, diagnostic methods, treatment options, and a review of the literature.Copyright  2018 Galen s.r.o. All rights reserved.

N2  - Aim: The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between escalating higher doses of psilocybin and the potential psilocybin occasioned positive subjective effects. Methods: Healthy participants (n=12) were given three escalating doses of oral psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg; 0.45 mg/kg; 0.6 mg/kg) or (18.8-36.6 mg; 27.1-54.0 mg; 36.3-59.2 mg) a minimum of four weeks apart in a supervised setting. Blood and urine samples, vital signs, and electrocardiograms were obtained. Subjective effects were assessed using the Mystical Experience Questionnaire and Persisting Effects Questionnaire. Results: There was a significant linear dose-related response in Mystical Experience Questionnaire total score and the transcendence of time and space subscale, but not in the rate of a complete mystical experience. There was also a significant difference between dose 3 compared to dose 1 on the transcendence of time and space subscale, while no dose-related differences were found for Mystical Experience Questionnaire total scores or rate of a mystical experience. Persisting Effects Questionnaire positive composite scores 30 days after completion of the last dose were significantly higher than negative composite scores. Persisting Effects Questionnaire results revealed a moderate increase in sense of well-being or life satisfaction on average that was associated with the maximum Mystical Experience Questionnaire total score. Pharmacokinetic measures were associated with dose but not with Mystical Experience Questionnaire total scores or rate of a mystical experience. Conclusions: High doses of psilocybin elicited subjective effects at least as strong as the lower doses and resulted in positive persisting subjective effects 30 days after, indicating that a complete mystical experience was not a prerequisite for positive outcomes.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Background: Recent pilot trials suggest feasibility and potential efficacy of psychedelic-facilitated addiction treatment interventions. Fifteen participants completed a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation pilot study between 2009 and 2015. Aims: The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to identify perceived mechanisms of change leading to smoking cessation in the pilot study; (2) to identify key themes in participant experiences and long-term outcomes to better understand the therapeutic process. Methods: Participants were invited to a retrospective follow-up interview an average of 30 months after initial psilocybin sessions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of the 15 participants. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants reported gaining vivid insights into self-identity and reasons for smoking from their psilocybin sessions. Experiences of interconnectedness, awe, and curiosity persisted beyond the duration of acute drug effects. Participants emphasised that the content of psilocybin experiences overshadowed any short-term withdrawal symptoms. Preparatory counselling, strong rapport with the study team, and a sense of momentum once engaged in the study treatment were perceived as vital additional factors in achieving abstinence. In addition, participants reported a range of persisting positive changes beyond smoking cessation, including increased aesthetic appreciation, altruism, and pro-social behaviour. Conclusions: The findings highlight the value of qualitative research in the psychopharmacological investigation of psychedelics. They describe perceived connections between drug- and non-drug factors, and provide suggestions for future research trial design and clinical applications.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Background: Recent pilot trials suggest feasibility and potential efficacy of psychedelic-facilitated addiction treatment interventions. Fifteen participants completed a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation pilot study between 2009 and 2015. Aims: The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to identify perceived mechanisms of change leading to smoking cessation in the pilot study; (2) to identify key themes in participant experiences and long-term outcomes to better understand the therapeutic process. Methods: Participants were invited to a retrospective follow-up interview an average of 30 months after initial psilocybin sessions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of the 15 participants. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants reported gaining vivid insights into self-identity and reasons for smoking from their psilocybin sessions. Experiences of interconnectedness, awe, and curiosity persisted beyond the duration of acute drug effects. Participants emphasised that the content of psilocybin experiences overshadowed any short-term withdrawal symptoms. Preparatory counselling, strong rapport with the study team, and a sense of momentum once engaged in the study treatment were perceived as vital additional factors in achieving abstinence. In addition, participants reported a range of persisting positive changes beyond smoking cessation, including increased aesthetic appreciation, altruism, and pro-social behaviour. Conclusions: The findings highlight the value of qualitative research in the psychopharmacological investigation of psychedelics. They describe perceived connections between drug- and non-drug factors, and provide suggestions for future research trial design and clinical applications.Copyright © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Aim: The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between escalating higher doses of psilocybin and the potential psilocybin occasioned positive subjective effects. Methods: Healthy participants (n=12) were given three escalating doses of oral psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg; 0.45 mg/kg; 0.6 mg/kg) or (18.8-36.6 mg; 27.1-54.0 mg; 36.3-59.2 mg) a minimum of four weeks apart in a supervised setting. Blood and urine samples, vital signs, and electrocardiograms were obtained. Subjective effects were assessed using the Mystical Experience Questionnaire and Persisting Effects Questionnaire. Results: There was a significant linear dose-related response in Mystical Experience Questionnaire total score and the transcendence of time and space subscale, but not in the rate of a complete mystical experience. There was also a significant difference between dose 3 compared to dose 1 on the transcendence of time and space subscale, while no dose-related differences were found for Mystical Experience Questionnaire total scores or rate of a mystical experience. Persisting Effects Questionnaire positive composite scores 30 days after completion of the last dose were significantly higher than negative composite scores. Persisting Effects Questionnaire results revealed a moderate increase in sense of well-being or life satisfaction on average that was associated with the maximum Mystical Experience Questionnaire total score. Pharmacokinetic measures were associated with dose but not with Mystical Experience Questionnaire total scores or rate of a mystical experience. Conclusions: High doses of psilocybin elicited subjective effects at least as strong as the lower doses and resulted in positive persisting subjective effects 30 days after, indicating that a complete mystical experience was not a prerequisite for positive outcomes.Copyright © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.

A1  - Nichols D.E. 
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Psychedelics (serotonergic hallucinogens) are powerful psychoactive substances that alter perception and mood and affect numerous cognitive processes. They are generally considered physiologically safe and do not lead to dependence or addiction. Their origin predates written history, and they were employed by early cultures in many sociocultural and ritual contexts. After the virtually contemporaneous discovery of (5R,8R)-(+)-lysergic acid-N,N-diethylamide (LSD)-25 and the identification of serotonin in the brain, early research focused intensively on the possibility that LSD and other psychedelics had a serotonergic basis for their action. Today there is a consensus that psychedelics are agonists or partial agonists at brain serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors, with particular importance on those expressed on apical dendrites of neocortical pyramidal cells in layer V. Several useful rodent models have been developed over the years to help unravel the neurochemical correlates of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor activation in the brain, and a variety of imaging techniques have been employed to identify key brain areas that are directly affected by psychedelics. Recent and exciting developments in the field have occurred in clinical research, where several double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 studies of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in patients with cancer-related psychosocial distress have demonstrated unprecedented positive relief of anxiety and depression. Two small pilot studies of psilocybinassisted psychotherapy also have shown positive benefit in treating both alcohol and nicotine addiction. Recently, blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography have been employed for in vivo brain imaging in humans after administration of a psychedelic, and results indicate that intravenously administered psilocybin and LSD produce decreases in oscillatory power in areas of the brain's default mode network.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.

N2  - Rationale: Synthetic hallucinogenic tryptamines, especially those originally described by Alexander Shulgin, continue to be abused in the USA. The range of subjective experiences produced by different tryptamines suggests that multiple neurochemical mechanisms are involved in their actions, in addition to the established role of agonist activity at serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors., Objectives: This study evaluated the interaction of a series of synthetic tryptamines with biogenic amine neurotransmitter transporters and with serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes implicated in psychedelic effects., Methods: Neurotransmitter transporter activity was determined in rat brain synaptosomes. Receptor activity was determined using calcium mobilization and DiscoveRx PathHunter assays in HEK293, Galpha16-CHO, and CHOk1 cells transfected with human receptors., Results: Twenty-one tryptamines were analyzed in transporter uptake and release assays, and 5-HT2A, serotonin 1A (5-HT1A), and 5-HT2A beta-arrestin functional assays. Eight of the compounds were found to have 5-HT-releasing activity. Thirteen compounds were found to be 5-HT uptake inhibitors or were inactive. All tryptamines were 5-HT2A agonists with a range of potencies and efficacies, but only a few compounds were 5-HT1A agonists. Most tryptamines recruited beta-arrestin through 5-HT2A activation., Conclusions: All psychoactive tryptamines are 5-HT2A agonists, but 5-HT transporter (SERT) activity may contribute significantly to the pharmacology of certain compounds. The in vitro transporter data confirm structure-activity trends for releasers and uptake inhibitors whereby releasers tend to be structurally smaller compounds. Interestingly, two tertiary amines were found to be selective substrates at SERT, which dispels the notion that 5-HT-releasing activity is limited only to primary or secondary amines. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - The psychedelic experience has been reported since antiquity, but there is relatively little known about the underlying neural mechanisms. A recent neuroimaging study on psilocybin revealed a pattern of decreased cerebral blood flow and functional disconnections that is surprisingly similar to that caused by various anesthetics. In this article, the authors review historical examples of psychedelic experiences induced by general anesthetics and then contrast the mechanisms by which these two drug classes generate altered states of consciousness.

N2  - The serotonin-2A receptor (5-HT2AR) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and related inhibitory gating and behavioral inhibition deficits of schizophrenia patients. The hallucinogen psilocybin disrupts automatic forms of sensorimotor gating and response inhibition in humans, but it is unclear so far whether the 5-HT2AR or 5-HT1AR agonist properties of its bioactive metabolite psilocin account for these effects. Thus, we investigated whether psilocybin-induced deficits in automatic and controlled inhibition in healthy humans could be attenuated by the 5-HT2A/2CR antagonist ketanserin. A total of 16 healthy participants received placebo, ketanserin (40 mg p.o.), psilocybin (260 mug/kg p.o.), or psilocybin plus ketanserin in a double-blind, randomized, and counterbalanced order. Sensorimotor gating was measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response. The effects on psychopathological core dimensions and behavioral inhibition were assessed by the altered states of consciousness questionnaire (5D-ASC), and the Color-Word Stroop Test. Psilocybin decreased PPI at short lead intervals (30 ms), increased all 5D-ASC scores, and selectively increased errors in the interference condition of the Stroop Test. Stroop interference and Stroop effect of the response latencies were increased under psilocybin as well. Psilocybin-induced alterations were attenuated by ketanserin pretreatment, whereas ketanserin alone had no significant effects. These findings suggest that the disrupting effects of psilocybin on automatic and controlled inhibition processes are attributable to 5-HT2AR stimulation. Sensorimotor gating and attentional control deficits of schizophrenia patients might be due to changes within the 5-HT2AR system.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 28 September 2011; doi:10.1038/npp.2011.228.

N2  - Rationale: Previous research suggests that classical psychedelic compounds can induce lasting changes in personality traits, attitudes and beliefs in both healthy subjects and patient populations. Aim: Here we sought to investigate the effects of psilocybin on nature relatedness and libertarian-authoritarian political perspective in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: This open-label pilot study with a mixed-model design studied the effects of psilocybin on measures of nature relatedness and libertarian-authoritarian political perspective in patients with moderate to severe TRD (n=7) versus age-matched non-treated healthy control subjects (n=7). Psilocybin was administered in two oral dosing sessions (10 mg and 25 mg) 1 week apart. Main outcome measures were collected 1 week and 7-12 months after the second dosing session. Nature relatedness and libertarian-authoritarian political perspective were assessed using the Nature Relatedness Scale (NR-6) and Political Perspective Questionnaire (PPQ-5), respectively. Results: Nature relatedness significantly increased (t(6)=-4.242, p=0.003) and authoritarianism significantly decreased (t(6)=2.120, p=0.039) for the patients 1 week after the dosing sessions. At 7-12 months post-dosing, nature relatedness remained significantly increased (t(5)=-2.707, p=0.021) and authoritarianism remained decreased at trend level (t(5)=-1.811, p=0.065). No differences were found on either measure for the non-treated healthy control subjects. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that psilocybin with psychological support might produce lasting changes in attitudes and beliefs. Although it would be premature to infer causality from this small study, the possibility of drug-induced changes in belief systems seems sufficiently intriguing and timely to deserve further investigation.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Psychedelic drugs are making waves as modern trials support their therapeutic potential and various media continue to pique public interest. In this opinion piece, we draw attention to a long-recognised component of the psychedelic treatment model, namely 'set' and 'setting' - subsumed here under the umbrella term 'context'. We highlight: (a) the pharmacological mechanisms of classic psychedelics (5-HT2A receptor agonism and associated plasticity) that we believe render their effects exceptionally sensitive to context, (b) a study design for testing assumptions regarding positive interactions between psychedelics and context, and (c) new findings from our group regarding contextual determinants of the quality of a psychedelic experience and how acute experience predicts subsequent long-term mental health outcomes. We hope that this article can: (a) inform on good practice in psychedelic research, (b) provide a roadmap for optimising treatment models, and (c) help tackle unhelpful stigma still surrounding these compounds, while developing an evidence base for long-held assumptions about the critical importance of context in relation to psychedelic use that can help minimise harms and maximise potential benefits.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Background: Recent evidence suggests that psychedelic use predicts reduced perpetration of intimate partner violence among men involved in the criminal justice system. However, the extent to which this association generalizes to community samples has not been examined, and potential mechanisms underlying this association have not been directly explored. Aims: The present study examined the association between lifetime psychedelic use and intimate partner violence among a community sample of men and women. The study also tested the extent to which the associations were mediated by improved emotion regulation. Methods: We surveyed 1266 community members aged 16-70 (mean age=22.78, standard deviation=7.71) using an online questionnaire that queried substance use, emotional regulation, and intimate partner violence. Respondents were coded as psychedelic users if they reported one or more instance of using lysergic acid diethylamide and/or psilocybin mushrooms in their lifetime. Results/outcomes: Males reporting any experience using lysergic acid diethylamide and/or psilocybin mushrooms had decreased odds of perpetrating physical violence against their current partner (odds ratio=0.42, p<0.05). Furthermore, our analyses revealed that male psychedelic users reported better emotion regulation when compared to males with no history of psychedelic use. Better emotion regulation mediated the relationship between psychedelic use and lower perpetration of intimate partner violence. This relationship did not extend to females within our sample. Conclusions/interpretation: These findings extend prior research showing a negative relationship between psychedelic use and intimate partner violence, and highlight the potential role of emotion regulation in this association.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Background: Psilocybin has recently shown antidepressant efficacy in human studies (1). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown. Objectives: Our studies will examine whether psilocybin-administration induces changes in gene and protein expression related to synaptic plasticity, as this may be related to its antidepressant effect (2). Methods: Rats will receive a single, intraperitoneal injection of psilocybin. Focusing on prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, we will examine changes in immediate early gene expression and protein expression, using qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. We will isolate synaptosomal fractions and measure the expression and complex-formation of pre-and postsynaptic proteins using two-color fluorescence immunoblotting and dual immunoprecipitation, to study the acute effects of psilocybin on receptor trafficking and synaptic regulation. Results: The studies are ongoing and will be the first to investigate psilocybin-induced changes in gene expression together with proteins expression in rats. Conclusion: Psilocybin has previously shown a great therapeutic potential for treating depression and has sparked a revival of the field of psychedelic research (3). The results from our studies will likely motivate further investigations into the signaling pathways induced by psilocybin and, in the future, help identify novel pharmacological targets for efficient treatment for depression.

N2  - Recent research suggests that functional connectivity changes may be involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Hyperconnectivity in the default mode network has been associated with psychopathology, but psychedelic serotonin agonists like psilocybin may profoundly disrupt these dysfunctional neural network circuits and provide a novel treatment for psychiatric disorders. We have reviewed the current literature to investigate the efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted therapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. There were seven clinical trials that investigated psilocybin-assisted therapy as a treatment for psychiatric disorders related to anxiety, depression, and substance use. All trials demonstrated reductions in psychiatric rating scale scores or increased response and remission rates. There were large effect sizes related to improved depression and anxiety symptoms. Psilocybin may also potentially reduce alcohol or tobacco use and increase abstinence rates in addiction, but the benefits of these two trials were less clear due to open-label study designs without statistical analysis. Psilocybin-assisted therapy efficacy and safety appear promising, but more robust clinical trials will be required to support FDA approval and identify the potential role in clinical psychiatry.Copyright © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

T1  - Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy: A paradigm shift in psychiatric research and development
A1  - Schenberg E.E. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Mental disorders are rising while development of novel psychiatric medications is declining. This stall in innovation has also been linked with intense debates on the current diagnostics and explanations for mental disorders, together constituting a paradigmatic crisis. A radical innovation is psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAP): professionally supervised use of ketamine, MDMA, psilocybin, LSD and ibogaine as part of elaborated psychotherapy programs. Clinical results so far have shown safety and efficacy, even for "treatment resistant" conditions, and thus deserve increasing attention from medical, psychological and psychiatric professionals. But more than novel treatments, the PAP model also has important consequences for the diagnostics and explanation axis of the psychiatric crisis, challenging the discrete nosological entities and advancing novel explanations for mental disorders and their treatment, in a model considerate of social and cultural factors, including adversities, trauma, and the therapeutic potential of some non-ordinary states of consciousness.Copyright © 2018 Schenberg.

N2  - Poison causes irritation, injury, illness, or death if a person tastes it, smells, and gets it on skin or in eye and may be solid, liquid, sprays, vapor or gases, etc., or even a good thing when used in a wrong way. Botulinum toxin is the deadliest substance known to man. Poison, toxin, and venom may be differentiated: any substance that has a noxious effect on living organisms is poison, a toxin is a poison produced by a living organism in nature and toxicants are synthesized chemical substances while venom is a toxin injected by a bite or sting from a living organism into another (delivery method). The poison is often used to describe any harmful substance, particularly corrosive substances, carcinogens, mutagens, teratogens and harmful pollutants, and to exaggerate the dangers of chemicals. Physical sources such as particulate radiation (alpha and beta particles) or electromagnetic waves (X-rays, gamma-rays, UV-rays) may cause harmful effects on living organisms. Paracelsus wrote: "Everything is poison; there is poison in everything; only the dose makes a thing not a poison". Some poisons exert their effects on the part they come in contact with (local effect), some exert their effect on one or more organ systems after absorption (systemic effect), while some poisons have both local and systemic effects (combined effect). General symptoms of poisoning include (i) sick feeling, (ii) diarrhea, (iii) stomach pain, (iv) drowsiness, dizziness or weakness, (v) high temperature (38 degreeC, 100.4 degreeF or above), (vi) chills (shivering), (vii) loss of appetite, (viii) headache, etc. Poisonous compounds may be useful either for their toxicity as pesticides in agriculture or in industry as chemical reagents, solvents or complexing reagents, but less common in household use. Hallucination is distortion in perceptions of reality caused by hallucinogens such as psychoactive agents like mescaline, psilocybin, ibogaine, LSD, etc. Most hallucinogens are alkaloids or related substances and may be smoked or snuffed, swallowed fresh or dried, drunk in decoctions and infusions, absorbed directly through the skin, placed in wounds or administered as enemas. Teratogens affect the development of an embryo or fetus and include radiation, maternal infections, maternal metabolic factors, exposure to 2,4-d spraying, chemicals, drugs, etc. A pesticide and weedicides are chemicals that prevent, destroy, or repel pests including insects, termites, nematodes, molluscs, mice and other rodents, weeds, fungi and microorganisms bacteria and viruses. Medicinal drugs are divided with respect to human organism are autobiogenous or natural, and (ii) xenobiotic or foreign. Biogenous drugs are involved in the conventional metabolic process while metabolic process of xenobiotics is subject to two major stages such as modification and conjugation. Metabolism of both biogenous substances and xenobiotics drugs is governed by the laws of enzyme kinetics. The metabolic conversion of xenobiotics is dependent on the occurrence of enzymes capable of catalyzing the conversion of these xenobiotics.Copyright © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

N2  - Anxiety and depression are some of the most common psychiatric symptoms of patients suffering with life-threatening diseases, often associated with a low quality of life and a poor overall prognosis. 5-HT2A-receptor agonists (serotonergic hallucinogens, 'psychedelics') like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin were first investigated as therapeutic agents in the 1960s. Recently, after a long hiatus period of regulatory obstacles, interest in the clinical use of these substances has resumed. The current article provides a systematic review of studies investigating psychedelics in the treatment of symptoms of existential distress in life-threatening diseases across different periods of research, highlighting how underlying concepts have developed over time. A systematic search for clinical trials from 1960 to 2017 revealed 11 eligible clinical trials involving a total number of N = 445 participants, of which 7 trials investigated the use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (N = 323), 3 trials investigated the use of psilocybin (N = 92), and one trial investigated the use of dipropyltryptamine (DPT) (N = 30). The 4 more recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 104) showed a significantly higher methodological quality than studies carried out in the 1960s and 1970s. Evidence supports that patients with life threatening diseases associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety benefit from the anxiolytic and antidepressant properties of serotonergic hallucinogens. Some studies anecdotally reported improvements in patients' quality of life and reduced fear of death. Moreover, low rates of side effects were reported in studies that adhered to safety guidelines. Further studies are needed to determine how these results can be transferred into clinical practice.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Psilocybin, the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms, is an agonist of various serotonin receptors. Seminal psilocybin positron emission tomography (PET) research suggested regional increases in glucose metabolism in frontal cortex (hyperfrontality). However, a recent arterial spin labeling (ASL) study suggests psilocybin may lead to hypo-perfusion in various brain regions. In this placebo-controlled, double-blind study we used pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) to measure perfusion changes, with and without adjustment for global brain perfusion, after two doses of oral psilocybin (low dose: 0.160 mg/kg; high dose: 0.215 mg/kg) in two groups of healthy controls (n = 29 in both groups, total N = 58) during rest. We controlled for sex and age and used family-wise error corrected p values in all neuroimaging analyses. Both dose groups reported profound subjective drug effects as measured by the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D-ASC) with the high dose inducing significantly larger effects in four out of the 11 scales. After adjusting for global brain perfusion, psilocybin increased relative perfusion in distinct right hemispheric frontal and temporal regions and bilaterally in the anterior insula and decreased perfusion in left hemispheric parietal and temporal cortices and left subcortical regions. Whereas, psilocybin significantly reduced absolute perfusion in frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, and bilateral amygdalae, anterior cingulate, insula, striatal regions, and hippocampi. Our analyses demonstrate consistency with both the hyperfrontal hypothesis of psilocybin and the more recent study demonstrating decreased perfusion, depending on analysis method. Importantly, our data illustrate that relative changes in perfusion should be understood and interpreted in relation to absolute signal variations.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Psychoactive substances as a last resort-a qualitative study of self-treatment of migraine and cluster headaches
A1  - Andersson M.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Background: Treatment resistant cluster headache and migraine patients are exploring alternative treatments online. The aim of this study was to improve comprehension regarding the use of non-established or alternative pharmacological treatments used by sufferers of cluster headaches and migraines. Methods: A qualitative thematic analysis of the users' own accounts presented in online forum discussions were conducted. The forum boards https://shroomery.org/ , http://bluelight.org , and https://clusterbusters.org/ met the inclusion criteria and were used for the study. Results: The analysis resulted in six themes: a desperate need for effective treatments; the role of the forum-finding alternative treatments and community support; alternative treatment substances; dosage and regimens; effects and treatment results; and adverse effects. The results provide an insight into why, how, and by which substances and methods sufferers seek relief from cluster headache and migraines. Conclusions: These patients are in a desperate and vulnerable situation, and illicit psychoactive substances are often considered a last resort. There appeared to be little or no interest in psychoactive effects per se as these were rather tolerated or avoided by using sub-psychoactive doses. Primarily, psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide, and related psychedelic tryptamines were reportedly effective for both prophylactic and acute treatment of cluster headache and migraines. Treatment results with cannabis were more unpredictable. No severe adverse events were reported, but it was observed how desperation sometimes spurred risky behavior when obtaining and testing various treatment alternatives. The forum discourse mainly revolved around maximizing treatment results and minimizing potential harms.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

N2  - Introduction: Psilocybin is a psychedelic tryptamine that has shown promise in recent clinical trials for the treatment of depression and substance use disorders. This open-label study of the pharmacokinetics of psilocybin was performed to describe the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of psilocybin in sequential, escalating oral doses of 0.3, 0.45, and 0.6 mg/kg in 12 healthy adults. Methods: Eligible healthy adults received 6-8 h of preparatory counseling in anticipation of the first dose of psilocybin. The escalating oral psilocybin doses were administered at approximately monthly intervals in a controlled setting and subjects were monitored for 24 h. Blood and urine samples were collected over 24 h and assayed by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay for psilocybin and psilocin, the active metabolite. The pharmacokinetics of psilocin were determined using both compartmental (NONMEM) and noncompartmental (WinNonlin) methods. Results: No psilocybin was found in plasma or urine, and renal clearance of intact psilocin accounted for less than 2% of the total clearance. The pharmacokinetics of psilocin were linear within the twofold range of doses, and the elimination half-life of psilocin was 3 h (standard deviation 1.1). An extended elimination phase in some subjects suggests hydrolysis of the psilocin glucuronide metabolite. Variation in psilocin clearance was not predicted by body weight, and no serious adverse events occurred in the subjects studied. Conclusions: The small amount of psilocin renally excreted suggests that no dose reduction is needed for subjects with mild-moderate renal impairment. Simulation of fixed doses using the pharmacokinetic parameters suggest that an oral dose of 25 mg should approximate the drug exposure of a 0.3 mg/kg oral dose of psilocybin. Although doses of 0.6 mg/kg are in excess of likely therapeutic doses, no serious physical or psychological events occurred during or within 30 days of any dose.

N2  - Psilocybin, a psychoactive alkaloid contained in hallucinogenic mushrooms, has recently been tested for its safety and efficacy in clinical populations for the treatment of depression, anxiety disorders and substance dependence. The main objective of this study is to summarize the mechanism of action of psilocybin and its efficacy in the treatment of different psychiatric conditions. We also present the ethical issues concerning psilocybin use in clinical practice and its safety profile. We did a review using the Pubmed database with the Mesh terms: "psilocybin" and "depression" or "anxiety" or "dependence". We selected clinical trials and reviews published in the last 20 years written in English, Portuguese or Spanish according to our aims. Psilocybin and psilocin (the psychoactive metabolite of psilocybin) are substances with predominant agonist activity on serotonin 5HT2A/C and 5HT1A receptors. Psilocybin acts as a hallucinogen and has a profound effect on cognition, perception and emotion, producing transient psychosis-like symptoms. Clinical trials showed that the administration of psilocybin resulted in significant reductions in Yale- Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, in anxiety scores and in tobacco and alcohol craving. The analysis of the psilocybin safety profile showed that it can be safely administered in controlled settings. The evidence overall strongly suggests that psilocybin should be re-examined in modern clinical trials for their use in non-psychotic mental health conditions.

N2  - After the discovery of the psychedelic effects of LSD in 1943 by Albert Hoffmann, the therapeutic potential of the compound was rapidly and intensively investigated across the 1950s. In the course of the 1960s psycholytic psychotherapy was propagated, whose advocates hoped to initiate salutary psychoanalytical processes in their patients by psychedelic experiences. In the frame of the counter culture of the 1960s and 1970s, self-experiments with serotonergic hallucinogens, such as LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin, got popular resulting in the criminalization ofthese substances at the beginning of the 1970s. Subsequently, recreational use of serotonergic hallucinogens decreased, while in parallel also human research with these drugs but also psycholytic therapy approaches faded out more and more. Since the end of the 1990s serotonergic hallucinogens now experience a revival in science and youth cultures. With the rise of electronic music styles, the consumption of serotonergic hallucinogens increased again and beyond the classical compounds also "novel psychoactive substances" drugs came to the drug market such as the 2C drugs, NBOMe derivates, benzodifurans, and novel tryptamines and ergolines. In psychiatry, serotonergic psychedelics, like psilocybin, DMT/Ayahuasca, and LSD, are in the research focus once more and have been recently proposed for the treatment of affective disorders and addiction. Correspondingly, psycholytic therapy approaches are currently controversially discussed again. Surprisingly, even after decades of research the potential neuropsychiatric long-term consequences of repeated administrations of serotonergic hallucinogens are still unclear.

N2  - Introduction.- A serotonin 5-HT2A/C agonist, psychedelic drug psilocybin, is gaining attention as a potential therapeutic tool for anxiety and depression. Psilocybin induces desynchronization of the EEG during the peak of its effects, continuous data are lacking. Objectives.- We focused on the dynamics of changes in neuropsychological parameters, brain activity and connectivity after oral administration of psilocybin. Methods.- Twenty healthy volunteers (10 M/10F, 28-50yrs) were enrolled in this placebo controlled cross over double blind trial. A standard 19 channel EEG (registered before and 60, 90, 180 and 360 min after psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) ingestion), brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), plasma levels of psilocin were collected several times over the session, a subjective scale "altered scale of consciousness scale (ASCs)" at the end of measurements. Current source density and connectivity were analysed by Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). Results.- Psilocybin induced psychotic-like symptoms, especially changes in perception and thought disturbances, peaking at 90 min after ingestion along with serum psilocin levels. Induced global decrease of the alpha current source density in the occipital cortex was negatively correlated with the intensity of effects. The overall connectivity decreased in the alpha band, but increased in all other frequency bands at peak, however, six hours after ingestion, the effects were inverted. Conclusions.- The study shows that psilocybin dynamically shifts the brain from one connectivity state at baseline through a peak effect to reach another global connectivity state at the end.

N2  - Recent studies suggest that the antidepressant effects of the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin are mediated through its modulatory properties on prefrontal and limbic brain regions including the amygdala. To further investigate the effects of psilocybin on emotion processing networks, we studied for the first-time psilocybin's acute effects on amygdala seed-to-voxel connectivity in an event-related face discrimination task in 18 healthy volunteers who received psilocybin and placebo in a double-blind balanced cross-over design. The amygdala has been implicated as a salience detector especially involved in the immediate response to emotional face content. We used beta-series amygdala seed-to-voxel connectivity during an emotional face discrimination task to elucidate the connectivity pattern of the amygdala over the entire brain. When we compared psilocybin to placebo, an increase in reaction time for all three categories of affective stimuli was found. Psilocybin decreased the connectivity between amygdala and the striatum during angry face discrimination. During happy face discrimination, the connectivity between the amygdala and the frontal pole was decreased. No effect was seen during discrimination of fearful faces. Thus, we show psilocybin's effect as a modulator of major connectivity hubs of the amygdala. Psilocybin decreases the connectivity between important nodes linked to emotion processing like the frontal pole or the striatum. Future studies are needed to clarify whether connectivity changes predict therapeutic effects in psychiatric patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP

N2  - Heterologous expression of multi-gene biosynthetic pathways in eukaryotic hosts is limited by highly regulated individual monocistrons. Dissimilar to prokaryotes, each eukaryotic gene is strictly controlled by its own regulatory elements, such as promoter and terminator. Consequently, parallel transcription can occur only when a group of genes is synchronously activated. A strategy to circumvent this limitation is the concerted expression of multiple genes as a polycistron. By exploiting the "stop-carry on" mechanism of picornaviruses, we have designed a sophisticated, yet easy-to-assemble vector system to heterologously express multiple genes under the control of a single promoter. For facile selection of correctly transformed colonies by basic fluorescence microscopy, our vector includes a split gene for a fluorescent reporter protein. This method was successfully applied to produce the psychotropic mushroom alkaloid psilocybin in high yields by heterologous expression of the entire biosynthetic gene cluster in the mould Aspergillus nidulans.Copyright © 2018

N2  - AL's leg was amputated resulting in phantom-limb pain (PLP). (1) When a volunteer placed her foot on or near the phantom-touching it evoked organized sensations in corresponding locations on AL's phantom. (2) Mirror-visual-feedback (MVF) relieved PLP, as did, "phantom massage". (3) Psilocybin-MVF pairing produced synergistic effects, complete elimination of PLP, and reduction in paroxysmal episodes. (4) Touching the volunteer's leg where AL previously had external fixators, evoked sensation of nails boring through the leg. Using a "telescoping" nail, we created the illusion of a nail being removed with corresponding pain relief. (5) Artificial flames produced warmth in the phantom.Copyright © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

T1  - Using in vitro norepinephrine transporter (NET) inhibition and 5-HT2 receptor binding data to predict psychoactive doses of novel psychoactive substances in humans

N2  - Objective Novel psychoactive substances (NPS) or "bath salts" are increasingly sold over the Internet and used as substitutes for classic recreational substances. Previous studies showed that classic amphetamine-type stimulants most potently act on the norepinephrine (NE) compared to the dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) system and NE activation correlated with the subjective effects across classic amphetamine-type substances. Additionally, NE has been shown to critically mediate the subjective and cardiostimulant effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). On the other hand subjective effects of classic serotonergic hallucinogens such as LSD or psilocybin have been shown to depend on serotonin 5-HT2A receptor stimulation. The aim of the present study was to characterize the role of the NE, DA, and 5-HT transporters (NET, DAT, and SERT, respectively) in the acute effects of novel psychoactive substances with amphetamine-like structures as well as the role of the 5-HT2 receptors in the psychoactivity of novel hallucinogens. Methods First, we assessed the 3H-monoamine uptake inhibition potency in a series of 33 NPS and classic amphetamine-like substances in HEK 293 cells expressing the human NET, DAT, and SERT. We also assessed radioligand-binding at the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptor of 20 classic and novel designer hallucinogens of the ergoline, tryptamine, phenethylamine, or benzodifuran class. Second, we collected information on the typically used oral doses of all these substances as reported in substance user forums or where available from clinical studies in humans. The in vitro monoamine transporter inhibition potency and 5-HT receptor binding affinity data was then correlated with the doses used in humans to induce subjective psychotropic effects. Results The amphetamine-type substances showed a wide range of monoamine transporter inhibition potencies indicating large variability in the pharmacology of amphetamine-type NPS (Table). Typically, inhibition of the DAT and NET was observed in NPS with reportedly stimulant-type clinical effects. Specifically, we found that the NET inhibition potency in vitro correlated significantly with the doses used by humans (R=0.50, P<0.01, N=33) while DAT or SERT inhibition potency showed no such association with the doses used (R=0.23, NS, N=33 and R=-0.26, NS, N=33). Thus, the pharmacological characteristic of NET inhibition in vitro best predicted the human psychoactive dose of the NPS indicating a role for the NET in the psychoactive effects of novel amphetamine-type substances. The clinical potency of hallucinogenic NPS and classic hallucinogens (tryptamines, hallucinogenic phenethylamines) was correlated with high significance with the binding affinity at serotonergic 5-HT2A (R=0.74, P<0.001, N=20), less strongly also 5-HT2C (R=0.66, P<0.01, N=20) but not 5-HT1A (R=0.09, NS, N=20) receptors. Conclusion NET inhibition potency in vitro may be a useful characteristic of NPS to predict their psychoactive doses in humans. Similarly, in vitro 5-HT2 receptor binding data of receptor agonists can be used to estimate whether novel substances likely exhibit hallucinogen-like psychoactive effects in humans and to provide dose estimates. In vitro pharmacological profiling is critical for the assessment of novel psychoactive substances but additional aspects such as route of administration, metabolism, and brain penetration also need to be studied.

N2  - New psychoactive tryptamines may be a public health risk since they intend to mimic the hallucinogenic effects of regulated psychoactive drugs. Few studies describe uses and clinical effects of unregulated new psychoactive tryptamines. This study aims (1) to explore the presence of tryptamines classified as NPS among the substances delivered for analysis to a harm-reduction organization; (2) to describe the substances found in the samples after analysis; and (3) to compare analytical results of regulated vs. non-regulated tryptamines. Samples delivered and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry from 2006 to 2015 were included. A descriptive study of results was conducted. From 25,296 samples that were delivered, 436 were tryptamines; from these 232 (53.21%) were non-regulated. The most delivered non-regulated tryptamine was 4-AcO-DMT. A search of the PubMed database in July 2016 revealed that no studies in humans have ever been carried out with 4-AcO-DMT. Unregulated tryptamines likely contained one unadulterated substance (p <= 0.001). The number of samples submitted which contained tryptamines increased during the course of the study, with significant differences in client expectations vs. analysis results between the controlled and uncontrolled groups. There is a need for further research in order to prevent the potential health risks associated with their use.Copyright © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Background Recently, scientific interest in the therapeutic potential of serotonergic and psilocybin hallucinogens (psychedelics) such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and entactogens like 3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) within the framework of psychotherapy has resumed. The present article provides an overview on the current evidence on substance-assisted psychotherapy with these substances. Method A selective search was carried out in the PubMed and Cochrane Library including studies investigating the clinical use of serotonergic psychoactive substances since 2000. Results Studies were found investigating the following indications: alcohol (LSD and psilocybin) and tobacco addiction (psilocybin), anxiety and depression in patients suffering from life-threatening somatic illness (LSD and psilocybin), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (psilocybin), treatment-resistant major depression (psilocybin), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (MDMA). Discussion Substance use disorders, PTSD and anxiety and depression in patients suffering from life-threatening somatic illness belong to the indications with the best evidence for substance-assisted psychotherapy with serotonergic psychoactive agents. To date, studies indicate efficacy and relatively good tolerability. Further studies are needed to determine whether these substances may represent suitable and effective treatment options for some treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders in the future.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.

N2  - The therapeutic use of psychedelic substances was concomitant with the discovery of LSD and Mescaline after the Second World War. These therapeutic uses initially concerned "the accompaniment" of psychotherapies, the treatment of addictions (alcohol, then opiates), and, because of their anxiolytic and antidepressive capacities, the management of post-traumatic psychological disorders, resistant depressions, obsessive and psychosomatic pathologies (pain, migraines, etc.) and support for the end of life. With the prohibition of the medical use of these substances during the 1960s (following their classification in the international conventions for the prohibition of narcotics), the research on neurophysiological and therapeutic activities was also stopped. A few rare experiments were continued during the 1980s (MDMA, ibogaine), but it is only since 1994 (authorization in the USA of the resumption of treatments with the MDMA at the end of life, then in PTSD) that research has resumed in most Western countries, except in France. At the same time, since the end of the 1990s, there has been a return to a reflection on the ancient use of psychedelic plants as part of the ethnographic interest in shamanism. Today, many scientific foundations (MAPS, The Beckley Foundation, Heffter Research Institute, etc.) and universities are studying the therapeutic effects of psychedelic substances, and clinical and neurobiological studies are gradually being resumed. The indications concern the management of addictions, the treatment of psychotraumatic disorders, in connection with psychotherapies, and all areas relating to anxiety and depression, as well as autistic states and "resistant schizophrenia" to conventional treatments.Copyright © De Boeck Superieur.

N2  - Background Sambucus ebulus is a rich source of ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) and RIP-related lectins generated from multiple genes. These proteins differ in their structure, enzymatic activity and sugar binding specificity. Methods We have purified and characterized ebulin-RP from S. ebulus leaves and determined the amino acid sequence by cDNA cloning. Cytotoxicity was studied in a variety of cancer cells and a comparative study of the ability of ebulin-RP to bind sugars using "in vitro" and "in silico" approaches was performed. Results Ebulin-RP is a novel heterodimeric type 2 RIP present in S. ebulus leaves together with the type 2 RIP ebulin l, which displayed rRNA N-glycosidase activity but unlike ebulin l, lacked functional sugar binding domains. As a consequence of changes in its B-chain, ebulin-RP displayed lower cytotoxicity than ebulin l towards cancer cells and induced apoptosis as the predominant pattern of cell death. Conclusions Ebulin-RP is a novel member of the ebulin gene family with low cytotoxicity as a result of deficient sugar binding domains. Type 2 RIP genes from Sambucus have evolved to render proteins with different sugar affinities that may be related to different biological activities and could result in an advantage for the plant. General significance The ebulin family of RIPs and lectins can serve as a good model for studying the evolutionary process which may have occurred in RIPs. The lack of cytotoxicity of ebulin-RP makes it a good candidate as a toxic moiety in the construction of immunotoxins and conjugates directed against specific targets.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Aim There have been significant changes in adolescent consumption habits over the past fifteen years. New molecules have been synthesized, new devices created and a number of products have increased in popularity; and as a result clinicians sometimes lack information. We chose to focus on this population because of its vulnerability, as adolescents show low sensitivity to long-term outcomes of their actions and may be easily influenced by peers as regards experimentation of new drugs. The most consumed products by adolescents in France are tobacco, alcohol and cannabis with the physiological effects and consumption patterns of these drugs well documented. The purpose of this review is to identify and describe other products that are frequently used by adolescents to get high, to increase performance, for purposes of self-medication or because of peer pressure. We summarized the current scientific evidence regarding drug availability, physical and chemical properties, pharmacodynamics and adverse effects. Method A literature review was conducted from 2000 to 2015 based on Pudmed, Google Scholar and governmental websites, using the following keyword alone or in combination: "adolescent", "new", "misuse", "abuse", "toxicity", "pharmacology" "cocaine", "MDMA", "inhalant", "poppers", "magic mushroom", "psilocybin", "designer drug", "legal high", "smart drug", "cathinone", "mephedrone", "cannabinoid", "prescription drug", "codeine", "opioid", "methylphenidate", "cough syrup", "purple drank". Results New products, including synthetic cannabis, cathinone or purple drank seem to be the most dangerous. They are easily accessible and may lead to short-term severe or lethal complications. Other substances do not pose a major short-term health risk by themselves. However, their consumption may be an indication of other unhealthy risk behaviors, such as prescription drug use, which may be related to psychiatric comorbidity. Unfortunately, we do not have enough data to determine the long-term consequences of the use of these substances. Moreover, these products have a strong addictive potential and may be a risk factor for other addictions. For this reason, increased supervision is justified, both for surveillance and reduction of harm. Conclusion Taking care of an adolescent with substance abuse can be difficult. Updated information regarding these new substances and the particular danger they pose to adolescent health is needed. Informed clinicians can provide up to date and accurate information to the patient and family, assess potential risk factors and comorbidities, and provide appropriate support. Furthermore, because of the high prevalence of substance abuse in the adolescent population, systematic screening of adolescent consumption habit is useful to avoid or anticipate complications. Often, problematic substance consumption behaviors are signs of more complicated psychological or psychiatric issues. Substance abuse behaviors will often disappear over time but they can also become a major problem as the adolescent moves into adulthood. If problems persist, consultation with an addiction specialist may be warranted.Copyright © 2016

T1  - Serotonin and brain function: A tale of two receptors
A1  - Carhart-Harris R.L.
A1  - Nutt D.J. 
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Previous attempts to identify a unified theory of brain serotonin function have largely failed to achieve consensus. In this present synthesis, we integrate previous perspectives with new and older data to create a novel bipartite model centred on the view that serotonin neurotransmission enhances two distinct adaptive responses to adversity, mediated in large part by its two most prevalent and researched brain receptors: the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. We propose that passive coping (i.e. tolerating a source of stress) is mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling and characterised by stress moderation. Conversely, we argue that active coping (i.e. actively addressing a source of stress) is mediated by 5-HT2AR signalling and characterised by enhanced plasticity (defined as capacity for change). We propose that 5-HT1AR-mediated stress moderation may be the brain's default response to adversity but that an improved ability to change one's situation and/or relationship to it via 5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity may also be important - and increasingly so as the level of adversity reaches a critical point. We propose that the 5-HT1AR pathway is enhanced by conventional 5-HT reuptake blocking antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), whereas the 5-HT2AR pathway is enhanced by 5-HT2AR-agonist psychedelics. This bipartite model purports to explain how different drugs (SSRIs and psychedelics) that modulate the serotonergic system in different ways, can achieve complementary adaptive and potentially therapeutic outcomes.Copyright © British Association for Psychopharmacology.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Plant-based psychedelics, such as psilocybin, have an ancient history of medicinal use. After the first English language report on LSD in 1950, psychedelics enjoyed a short-lived relationship with psychology and psychiatry. Used most notably as aids to psychotherapy for the treatment of mood disorders and alcohol dependence, drugs such as LSD showed initial therapeutic promise before prohibitive legislature in the mid-1960s effectively ended all major psychedelic research programs. Since the early 1990s, there has been a steady revival of human psychedelic research: last year saw reports on the first modern brain imaging study with LSD and three separate clinical trials of psilocybin for depressive symptoms. In this circumspective piece, RLC-H and GMG share their opinions on the promises and pitfalls of renewed psychedelic research, with a focus on the development of psilocybin as a treatment for depression.Copyright © 2017 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

N2  - Background: Impaired empathic abilities lead to severe negative social consequences and influence the development and treatment of several psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, empathy has been shown to play a crucial role in moral and prosocial behavior. Although the serotonin system has been implicated in modulating empathy and moral behavior, the relative contribution of the various serotonin receptor subtypes is still unknown. Methods: We investigated the acute effect of psilocybin (0.215 mg/kg p.o.) in healthy human subjects on different facets of empathy and hypothetical moral decision-making using the multifaceted empathy test (n = 32) and the moral dilemma task (n = 24). Results: Psilocybin significantly increased emotional, but not cognitive empathy compared with placebo, and the increase in implicit emotional empathy was significantly associated with psilocybin-induced changed meaning of percepts. In contrast, moral decision-making remained unaffected by psilocybin. Conclusions: These findings provide first evidence that psilocybin has distinct effects on social cognition by enhancing emotional empathy but not moral behavior. Furthermore, together with previous findings, psilocybin appears to promote emotional empathy presumably via activation of serotonin 2A/1A receptors, suggesting that targeting serotonin 2A/1A receptors has implications for potential treatment of dysfunctional social cognition.Copyright © 2017 The Author.

T1  - Dreams and psychedelics: Neurophenomenological comparison and therapeutic implications
A1  - Kraehenmann R. 
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Background: A resurgence of neurobiological and clinical research is currently underway into the therapeutic potential of serotonergic or 'classical' psychedelics, such as the prototypical psychedelic drug lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N,Ndimethyltryptamine), and ayahuasca-a betacarboline-and dimethyltryptamine (DMT)-containing Amazonian beverage. The aim of this review is to introduce readers to the similarities and dissimilarities between psychedelic states and night dreams, and to draw conclusions related to therapeutic applications of psychedelics in psychiatry. Methods: Research literature related to psychedelics and dreaming is reviewed, and these two states of consciousness are systematically compared. Relevant conclusions with regard to psychedelicassisted therapy will be provided. Results: Common features between psychedelic states and night dreams include perception, mental imagery, emotion activation, fear memory extinction, and sense of self and body. Differences between these two states are related to differential perceptual input from the environment, clarity of consciousness and meta-cognitive abilities. Therefore, psychedelic states are closest to lucid dreaming which is characterized by a mixed state of dreaming and waking consciousness. Conclusion: The broad overlap between dreaming and psychedelic states supports the notion that psychedelics acutely induce dreamlike subjective experiences which may have long-term beneficial effects on psychosocial functioning and well-being. Future clinical studies should examine how therapeutic outcome is related to the acute dreamlike effects of psychedelics.Copyright © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.

T1  - Energy drinks and escalation in drug use severity: An emergent hazard to adolescent health
A1  - Leal W.E.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - The aim of the current study is to determine whether energy drink consumption contributes to drug use and, more specifically, an escalation in the severity of drug use. We first examine the association between energy drink use and hard drug use, and subsequently investigate whether soft drug use mediates this relationship. Potential moderating influences are also investigated by testing whether the degree of mediation varies by age, gender, and race. The current study uses a nationally representative sample of 8th (ages 13-14), 10th (ages 15-16), and 12th (ages 17-18) grade adolescents from the 2015 Monitoring the Future survey. Negative binomial regression is employed to examine associations between energy drink consumption and soft and hard drug use. Mediation results indicate that energy drink consumption is significantly associated with increased soft drug use, which is, in turn, associated with significant increases in hard drug use. This cascading effect of energy drink consumption on drug use appears to be stronger among younger females and older males. Results for the moderating effect of race are mixed. Energy drinks appear to pose an important threat to adolescent health in the form of soft and hard drug use. The United States may want to consider adopting energy drink policies similar to European countries and Canada, which require warning labels on beverages with high caffeine content.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Taking Psychedelics Seriously
A1  - Byock I. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Background: Psychiatric research in the 1950s and 1960s showed potential for psychedelic medications to markedly alleviate depression and suffering associated with terminal illness. More recent published studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of psilocybin, MDMA, and ketamine when administered in a medically supervised and monitored approach. A single or brief series of sessions often results in substantial and sustained improvement among people with treatment-resistant depression and anxiety, including those with serious medical conditions. Need and Clinical Considerations: Palliative care clinicians occasionally encounter patients with emotional, existential, or spiritual suffering, which persists despite optimal existing treatments. Such suffering may rob people of a sense that life is worth living. Data from Oregon show that most terminally people who obtain prescriptions to intentionally end their lives are motivated by non-physical suffering. This paper overviews the history of this class of drugs and their therapeutic potential. Clinical cautions, adverse reactions, and important steps related to safe administration of psychedelics are presented, emphasizing careful patient screening, preparation, setting and supervision. Conclusion: Even with an expanding evidence base confirming safety and benefits, political, regulatory, and industry issues impose challenges to the legitimate use of psychedelics. The federal expanded access program and right-to-try laws in multiple states provide precendents for giving terminally ill patients access to medications that have not yet earned FDA approval. Given the prevalence of persistent suffering and growing acceptance of physician-hastened death as a medical response, it is time to revisit the legitimate therapeutic use of psychedelics.Copyright © Ira Byock 2018.

N2  - Background: Prior data suggests the 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin (PSILO) improves smoking cessation outcomes. Here, we examine cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these encouraging results. The multisource interference task (MSIT) is employed as an assay of changes in cognitive control processes mediated by PSILO administration in treatment-seeking smokers. Methods: N=9 treatment-seeking smokers performed the MSIT while undergoing fMRI scanning during 2 sessions: prior to beginning cessation treatment and again 24 hours after receiving a single PSILO dose (30mg/70kg) in a supported, therapeutic context. Behavioral and fMRI data were collected during each fMRI session. Results: Following PSILO administration as compared to baseline, a reduction in congruency effect (incompatible e compatible) for correct trial reaction time (t(8)= 6.21, p=.003) was observed. However, no difference in congruency effect for accuracy (t(8)=0.52, p=.61) was observed. Concurrently, fMRI results showed a reduced congruency effect in MSIT-elicited activation in bilateral superior parietal cortex following PSILO (p- corrected <.05)[Right: TLRC, xyz, -27, -64, 39; Left: 27, -62, 46]). In addition, the positive correlation between reaction time and parietal activation congruency effects observed at baseline (r=.67, p=.047) was absent following PSILO (r=.25, p=.50). Conclusions: The observed PSILO-mediated decrease in task-evoked brain activity is consistent with the limited literature on the acute effects of PSILO in healthy participants. The posterior parietal ROI identified has been previously labeled a multiple demand hub, showing activation with increased demand across several cognitive control tasks. The current results suggest that, for smokers, PSILO decreases the salience of conflict-inducing stimuli which paradoxically leads to improved performance.

N2  - A growing body of evidence shows that existential and spiritual well-being in cancer patients is associated with better medical outcomes, improved quality of life, and serves as a buffer against depression, hopelessness, and desire for hastened death. Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in treating cancer-related anxiety and depression. A double-blind controlled trial was performed, where 29 patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned to treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or niacin in conjunction with psychotherapy. Previously published results of this trial demonstrated that, in conjunction with psychotherapy, moderate-dose psilocybin produced rapid, robust, and enduring anxiolytic, and anti-depressant effects. Here, we illustrate unique clinical courses described by four participants using quantitative measures of acute and persisting effects of psilocybin, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and spiritual well-being, as well as qualitative interviews, written narratives, and clinician notes. Although the content of each psilocybin-assisted experience was unique to each participant, several thematic similarities and differences across the various sessions stood out. These four participants' personal narratives extended beyond the cancer diagnosis itself, frequently revolving around themes of self-compassion and love, acceptance of death, and memories of past trauma, though the specific details or narrative content differ substantially. The results presented here demonstrate the personalized nature of the subjective experiences elicited through treatment with psilocybin, particularly with respect to the spiritual and/or psychological needs of each patient.Copyright © 2018 Malone, Mennenga, Guss, Podrebarac, Owens, Bossis, Belser, Agin-Liebes, Bogenschutz and Ross.

T1  - Lifetime experience with (classic) psychedelics predicts pro-environmental behavior through an increase in nature relatedness
A1  - Forstmann M.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - In a large-scale (N = 1487) general population online study, we investigated the relationship between past experience with classic psychedelic substances (e.g. LSD, psilocybin, mescaline), nature relatedness, and ecological behavior (e.g. saving water, recycling). Using structural equation modeling we found that experience with classic psychedelics uniquely predicted self-reported engagement in pro-environmental behaviors, and that this relationship was statistically explained by people's degree of self-identification with nature. Our model controlled for experiences with other classes of psychoactive substances (cannabis, dissociatives, empathogens, popular legal drugs) as well as common personality traits that usually predict drug consumption and/or nature relatedness (openness to experience, conscientiousness, conservatism). Although correlational in nature, results suggest that lifetime experience with psychedelics in particular may indeed contribute to people's pro-environmental behavior by changing their self-construal in terms of an incorporation of the natural world, regardless of core personality traits or general propensity to consume mind-altering substances. Thereby, the present research adds to the contemporary literature on the beneficial effects of psychedelic substance use on mental wellbeing, hinting at a novel area for future research investigating their potentially positive effects on a societal level. Limitations of the present research and future directions are discussed.Copyright © The Author(s) 2017.

T1  - Potential Therapeutic Effects of Psilocybin
A1  - Johnson M.W.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Psilocybin and other 5-hydroxytryptamine2A agonist classic psychedelics have been used for centuries as sacraments within indigenous cultures. In the mid-twentieth century they were a focus within psychiatry as both probes of brain function and experimental therapeutics. By the late 1960s and early 1970s these scientific inquires fell out of favor because classic psychedelics were being used outside of medical research and in association with the emerging counter culture. However, in the twenty-first century, scientific interest in classic psychedelics has returned and grown as a result of several promising studies, validating earlier research. Here, we review therapeutic research on psilocybin, the classic psychedelic that has been the focus of most recent research. For mood and anxiety disorders, three controlled trials have suggested that psilocybin may decrease symptoms of depression and anxiety in the context of cancer-related psychiatric distress for at least 6 months following a single acute administration. A small, open-label study in patients with treatment-resistant depression showed reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms 3 months after two acute doses. For addiction, small, open-label pilot studies have shown promising success rates for both tobacco and alcohol addiction. Safety data from these various trials, which involve careful screening, preparation, monitoring, and follow-up, indicate the absence of severe drug-related adverse reactions. Modest drug-related adverse effects at the time of medication administration are readily managed. US federal funding has yet to support therapeutic psilocybin research, although such support will be important to thoroughly investigate efficacy, safety, and therapeutic mechanisms.Copyright © 2017, The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.

T1  - The experience elicited by hallucinogens presents the highest similarity to dreaming within a large database of psychoactive substance reports
A1  - Sanz C.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Ever since the modern rediscovery of psychedelic substances by Western society, several authors have independently proposed that their effects bear a high resemblance to the dreams and dreamlike experiences occurring naturally during the sleep-wake cycle. Recent studies in humans have provided neurophysiological evidence supporting this hypothesis. However, a rigorous comparative analysis of the phenomenology ("what it feels like" to experience these states) is currently lacking. We investigated the semantic similarity between a large number of subjective reports of psychoactive substances and reports of high/low lucidity dreams, and found that the highest-ranking substance in terms of the similarity to high lucidity dreams was the serotonergic psychedelic lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), whereas the highest-ranking in terms of the similarity to dreams of low lucidity were plants of the Datura genus, rich in deliriant tropane alkaloids. Conversely, sedatives, stimulants, antipsychotics, and antidepressants comprised most of the lowest-ranking substances. An analysis of the most frequent words in the subjective reports of dreams and hallucinogens revealed that terms associated with perception ("see," "visual," "face," "reality," "color"), emotion ("fear"), setting ("outside," "inside," "street," "front," "behind") and relatives ("mom," "dad," "brother," "parent," "family") were the most prevalent across both experiences. In summary, we applied novel quantitative analyses to a large volume of empirical data to confirm the hypothesis that, among all psychoactive substances, hallucinogen drugs elicit experiences with the highest semantic similarity to those of dreams. Our results and the associated methodological developments open the way to study the comparative phenomenology of different altered states of consciousness and its relationship with non-invasive measurements of brain physiology.Copyright © 2018 Sanz and Tagliazucchi.

A1  - Griffiths R.R. 
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Data suggest psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may hold therapeutic potential in the treatment of addictions, including tobacco dependence. This retrospective cross-sectional anonymous online survey characterized 358 individuals (52 females) who reported having quit or reduced smoking after ingesting a psychedelic in a non-laboratory setting >=1 year ago. On average, participants smoked 14 cigarettes/day for 8 years, and had five previous quit attempts before their psychedelic experience. Of the 358 participants, 38% reported continuous smoking cessation after psychedelic use (quitters). Among quitters, 74% reported >2 years' abstinence. Of the 358 participants, 28% reported a persisting reduction in smoking (reducers), from a mode of 300 cigarettes/month before, to a mode of 1 cigarette/month after the experience. Among reducers, 62% reported >2 years of reduced smoking. Finally, 34% of the 358 participants (relapsers) reported a temporary smoking reduction before returning to baseline smoking levels, with a mode time range to relapse of 3-6 months. Relapsers rated their psychedelic experience significantly lower in personal meaning and spiritual significance than both other groups. Participants across all groups reported less severe affective withdrawal symptoms (e.g. depression, craving) after psychedelic use compared with previous quit attempts, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for psychedelic-associated smoking cessation/reduction. Changes in life priorities/values were endorsed as the most important psychological factor associated with smoking cessation/reduction. Results suggest psychedelics may hold promise in treating tobacco addiction as potentially mediated by spiritual experience, changed priorities/values, and improved emotional regulation.Copyright © The Author(s) 2017.

T1  - LSD treatment in Scandinavia: emphasizing indications and short-term treatment outcomes of 151 patients in Denmark
A1  - Larsen J.K. 
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Background: New research has suggested the clinical use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin in selected patient populations. However, concerns about the clinical use of LSD were advanced in a large Danish follow-up study that assessed 151 LSD-treated psychiatric patients approximately 25 years after their treatment in the 1960s. Aims: The purpose of the present study was to give a retrospective account of the short-term outcome of LSD treatment in these 151 Danish psychiatric patients. Methods: The LSD case material in the Danish State Archives consists of medical case records of 151 LSD-treated patients, who complained and received economic compensation with the LSD Damages Law. The author carefully read and reviewed the LSD case material. Results: LSD was used to treat a wide spectrum of mental disorders. Independent of diagnoses, 52 patients improved, and 48 patients worsened acutely with the LSD treatment. In a subgroup of 82 neurotic patients, the LSD dose-index (number of treatments multiplied by the maximal LSD dose) indicated the risk of acute worsening. In another subgroup of 19 patients with obsessive-compulsive neurosis, five patients later underwent psychosurgery. A small subgroup of 12 patients was treated with psilocybin. The long-term outcome was poor in most of the patients. Conclusions: Despite the significant limitations to a retrospective design, this database warrants caution in mental health patients. The use of LSD and psilocybin in mental health patients may be associated with serious short- and long-term side effects. Until further trials with rigorous designs have cleared these drugs of their potential harms, their clinical utility in these groups of patients has not been fully clarified.Copyright © 2017 The Nordic Psychiatric Association.

N2  - Background: Laetiporus sulphureus is an Agaricomycetes mushroom frequently referred to by its common name "Chicken of the woods" due to its distinctive flavor and texture. A single case report from 1988 associated consumption with hallucinations and ataxia in a 6-year-old child. L. sulphureus has not been demonstrated to contain psilocybin or other known hallucinogens but is classified as a "Group 6 Mushrooms: Hallucinogenics (Psilocybin and Psilocin)" in Micromedex. Research Question: We sought to characterize L. sulphureus exposures reported to the NPDS database and to determine the incidence of reported hallucinations or ataxia. Methods: All single-substance human exposures to Group 6 Mushrooms: Hallucinogenics (Generic Code 058000) from 2000 to 2015 were identified in the NPDS database. Exposures to L. sulphureus were identified as a subset using its product code 4191469. Non-ingestion routes were excluded. Data was analyzed using Excel and descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Clinical effects coded as "related" or "unknown if related" were considered to be present. The primary outcome was the incidence of hallucinations or ataxia. The subset of followed cases was analyzed for the incidence of moderate and major outcomes. Results: All cases of L. sulphureus in the NPDS dataset were included in this subset. A total of 113 of 114 exposures to L. sulphureus were inges-tions and one inhalation case was excluded. Monthly exposures peak in October and annual exposures peak in 2014. Clinical effects were pre-dominantly gastrointestinal. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea was reported in 71 of 113 cases. Hallucinations and ataxia were not coded in any case. The 73 known outcomes were overall mild with only nine moderate effects; no deaths or major effects were coded. Discussion: L. sulphureus has a reputation for being an edible mushroom despite previously reported hallucinations and ataxia. No cases associated with these clinical effects were identified nor were further examples found in the literature. Exposures appear relatively benign but have the potential for gastrointestinal effects. Conclusion: L. sulphureus ingestions appear benign. Its inclusion within the generic code for hallucinogenic mushrooms appears unwarranted. When reviewing NPDS data one should also consider product code names.

T1  - Challenges in Laboratory Detection of Unusual Substance Abuse: Issues with Magic Mushroom, Peyote Cactus, Khat, and Solvent Abuse
A1  - Dasgupta A. 
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Drug abuse is a worldwide problem. Although commonly abused drugs can be identified during routine urine drug testing, less commonly abused drugs may escape detection. These less commonly abused drugs not only include some designer drugs such as synthetic cannabinoid but also include abuse of psychedelic magic mushroom (active ingredients: psilocybin and psilocin), peyote cactus (active ingredient: mescaline), and khat plants (active ingredient: cathinone). Moreover, solvent and glue abuse is gaining popularity among teenagers and young adults which may even cause fatality. Amphetamine/methamphetamine immunoassay has a low cross-reactivity with psilocin. Cathinone, if present in the urine, can be detected by amphetamine/methamphetamine immunoassay due to cross-reactivity of cathinone with assay antibody. Currently there is one commercially available immunoassay which is capable of detecting synthetic cathinone known as bath salts as well as mescaline. However, gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry as well as liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)-based method is available for confirmation of the active ingredients present in magic mushroom, peyote cactus, and khat plant. Such chromatography-based methods also offer more sensitivity and specificity compared to an immunoassay.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Nutritional deficiency in combination with drug abuse may increase risk of developing the metabolic syndrome by augmenting cell damage, excitotoxicity, reducing energy production, and lowering the antioxidant potential of the cells. We have reviewed here the following points: effects of drugs of abuse on nutrition and brain metabolism; effects of nutrition on actions of the drugs of abuse; drug abuse and probability of developing metabolic syndrome; role of genetic vulnerability in nutrition/drug abuse and brain damage; and the role of neuroprotective supplements in drug abuse. Nutrition education is an essential component of substance abuse treatment programs and can enhance substance abuse treatment outcomes. The strategies available, in particular the nutritional approach to protect the drug abusers from the metabolic syndrome and other diseases are discussed. © 2006 New York Academy of Sciences.

N2  - Background and objectives: Considering the increasing prevalence of depression, many studies are launched to investigate new antidepressant treatments. The present research has shown how psilocybin as an active compound of Psilocybe cubensis (Earle) Singer extract (PCE) can change the parameters related to depression and anxiety in animal models. Both serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5-HT) and glutamate modulate depressive-like behaviors and, therefore, we examined the possible interaction of psilocybin as 5-HT1 agonist with glutamate receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Methods: Psilocybe cubensis extract of this mushroom was prepared by ethyl acetate. NMRI mice involved in all experiments and were treated with the vehicle, extract, or standard drug intraperitoneally. Open field (OFT), forced swimming (FST) and tail suspension tests (TST) were applied to measure the intended parameters. OFT was performed to verify the applied doses for measuring the following antidepressant activity. Results: PCE at the doses of 100 mg/kg significantly changed the locomotion, time spent in center and velocity of the animals in OFT. While treatment of the animals with PCE 10 and 40 mg/kg or ketamine 1 mg/kg did not alter the locomotor activity, co-administration of these subeffective amounts significantly reduced the immobility time in both FST and TST. Conclusion: These effects may indicate possible implication of psilocybin with NMDA receptor which consequently produces the antidepressant effects.Copyright © 2018. Open access.

N2  - Background: Death anxiety is a common issue in adult patients with advanced cancer and can have a large impact on quality of life and end-of-life care. Interventions are available to assist but are scarcely used in everyday practice. Aim: To assess quantitative studies on interventions for adult patients with advanced cancer suffering from death anxiety. Data sources: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and CINAHL were searched to identify quantitative or mixed studies on death anxiety or relatable existential intervention studies in advanced cancer patients published from 1990 to December 2016. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed relevant studies for eligibility. Data were then extracted from included studies for analysis. Results: Nine unique quantitative studies were identified, including five randomised controlled trials, involving a total overall of 1179 advanced cancer patients. All studies were psychotherapeutic in nature and centred on existential themes such as meaning, dignity, relationships and spiritual well-being. The therapies investigated shared overlapping themes but varied in duration, therapist experience, training required and burden on patient. Heterogeneity of studies and measures prevented determination of an overall effect size. Conclusion: Interventions were identified for this clinical scenario of death anxiety in patients with advanced cancer. Therapies of short duration incorporating spiritual well-being and those evoking a sense of meaning were claimed to be the most beneficial, despite lacking rigorous statistical analysis. More high-quality studies with tailored outcome measures are required to fully evaluate the most effective interventions for death anxiety in patients with advanced cancer.Copyright © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

T1  - Unifying theories of psychedelic drug effects
A1  - Swanson L.R. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - How do psychedelic drugs produce their characteristic range of acute effects in perception, emotion, cognition, and sense of self? How do these effects relate to the clinical efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapies? Efforts to understand psychedelic phenomena date back more than a century in Western science. In this article I review theories of psychedelic drug effects and highlight key concepts which have endured over the last 125 years of psychedelic science. First, I describe the subjective phenomenology of acute psychedelic effects using the best available data. Next, I review late 19th-century and early 20th-century theories-model psychoses theory, filtration theory, and psychoanalytic theory-and highlight their shared features. I then briefly review recent findings on the neuropharmacology and neurophysiology of psychedelic drugs in humans. Finally, I describe recent theories of psychedelic drug effects which leverage 21st-century cognitive neuroscience frameworks-entropic brain theory, integrated information theory, and predictive processing-and point out key shared features that link back to earlier theories. I identify an abstract principle which cuts across many theories past and present: psychedelic drugs perturb universal brain processes that normally serve to constrain neural systems central to perception, emotion, cognition, and sense of self. I conclude that making an explicit effort to investigate the principles and mechanisms of psychedelic drug effects is a uniquely powerful way to iteratively develop and test unifying theories of brain function.Copyright © 2018 Swanson.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Research on the clinical applications of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy has demonstrated promising early results for treatment of alcohol dependence. Detailed description of the content and methods of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, as it is conducted in clinical settings, is scarce. Methods: An open-label pilot (proof-of-concept) study of psilocybin-assisted treatment of alcohol dependence (NCT01534494) was conducted to generate data for a phase 2 RCT (NCT02061293) of a similar treatment in a larger population. The present paper presents a qualitative content analysis of the 17 debriefing sessions conducted in the pilot study, which occurred the day after corresponding psilocybin medication sessions. Results: Participants articulated a series of key phenomena related to change in drinking outcomes and acute subjective effects of psilocybin. Discussion: The data illuminate change processes in patients' own words during clinical sessions, shedding light on potential therapeutic mechanisms of change and how participants express effects of psilocybin. This study is unique in analyzing actual clinical sessions, as opposed to interviews of patients conducted separately from treatment.Copyright © 2018 Nielson, May, Forcehimes and Bogenschutz.

N2  - Objectives *Identify types of suffering of a psychological, emotional, social, spiritual, or existential nature that are potential indications for supervised therapy involving psychedelic medications, as well as important contraindications to this class of drugs. *Apply findings from the evidence base of clinical research of psychedelic therapies to the treatment of persistent depression, existential suffering in terminal illness, and severe PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). *Discuss the public health concerns, ethical, and socio-political issues pertinent to research and clinical use of psychedelics. Severe psychological and existential suffering robs people of meaningful quality of life and brings some to desire to end their lives. Currently available treatments for depression, anxiety, and spiritual distress often fail to alleviate suffering among people who are seriously ill. Renewed research involving psilocybin, MDMA and similar psychedelic compounds suggests that this class of drugs has important therapeutic potential in treatments for persistent, non-physical suffering. Psychedelic properties of specific plants (mushrooms and cactuses) have been used for centuries by indigenous cultures to induce expanded states of consciousness and spiritual experiences. Research sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health during the 1950s and early 1960s showed the potential for drugs of this class to markedly alleviate depression and existential suffering among people with cancer. However, non-medical use of these drugs and associated social upheavals resulted in psychedelics being classified as Schedule 1 drugs and banned from medical use. Recent studies by Dr. Grob and others have shown substantial improvements in mood, hopefulness, and wellbeing when these medications were administered to carefully screened patients under medical supervision as adjuncts to psychotherapy. A growing number of published studies with findings of high efficacy and few side effects have rekindled serious consideration of their therapeutic value and interest in pursuing regulatory changes to enable further research of their clinical use. Cases of people with treatment-resistant depression and PTSD will be presented. Rates of effectiveness of current therapeutic approaches and side-effect profiles of available anti-depressants and anxiolytics will be discussed. Dr. Grob will review the pharmacology, clinical trials, and neurobiology of psychedelics, including evidence from functional imaging. Dr. Byock will discuss the clinical indications, contraindications, and side-effects of these medications. Both faculty will discuss the socio-political, legal and regulatory challenges of prescribing and using psychedelics in carefully monitored ways.

N2  - After a hiatus of some 40 years, clinical research has resumed on the use of classic hallucinogens to treat addiction. Following completion of a small open-label feasibility study, we are currently conducting a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of psilocybin-assisted treatment of alcohol use disorder. Although treatment effects cannot be analyzed until the study is complete, descriptive case studies provide a useful window into the therapeutic process of psychedelic-assisted treatment of addiction. Here we describe treatment trajectories of three participants in the ongoing trial to illustrate the range of experiences and persisting effects of psilocybin treatment. Although it is difficult to generalize from a few cases, several qualitative conclusions can be drawn from the data presented here. Although participants often find it difficult to describe much of their psilocybin experience, pivotal moments tend to be individualized, extremely vivid, and memorable. Often, the qualitative content extends beyond the clinical problem that is being addressed. The participants discussed in this paper experienced acute and lasting alterations in their perceptions of self, in the quality of their baseline consciousness, and in their relationship with alcohol and drinking. In these cases, experiences of catharsis, forgiveness, self-compassion, and love were at least as salient as classic mystical content. Finally, feelings of increased "spaciousness" or mindfulness, and increased control over choices and behavior were reported following the drug administration sessions. Ultimately, psilocybin-assisted treatment appears to elicit experiences that are extremely variable, yet seem to meet the particular needs of the individual.Copyright © 2018 Bogenschutz, Podrebarac, Duane, Amegadzie, Malone, Owens, Ross and Mennenga.

N2  - Therapeutic sleep deprivation (SD) is a rapid acting treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Within hours, SD leads to a dramatic decrease in depressive symptoms in 50-60% of patients with MDD. Scientifically, therapeutic SD presents a unique paradigm to study the neurobiology of MDD. Yet, up to now, the neurobiological basis of the antidepressant effect, which is most likely different from today's first-line treatments, is not sufficiently understood. This article puts the idea forward that sleep/wake-dependent shifts in synaptic plasticity, i.e., the neural basis of adaptive network function and behavior, represent a critical mechanism of therapeutic SD in MDD. Particularly, this article centers on two major hypotheses of MDD and sleep, the synaptic plasticity hypothesis of MDD and the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis of sleep-wake regulation, and on how they can be integrated into a novel synaptic plasticity model of therapeutic SD in MDD. As a major component, the model proposes that therapeutic SD, by homeostatically enhancing cortical synaptic strength, shifts the initially deficient inducibility of associative synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) in patients with MDD in a more favorable window of associative plasticity. Research on the molecular effects of SD in animals and humans, including observations in the neurotrophic, adenosinergic, monoaminergic, and glutamatergic system, provides some support for the hypothesis of associative synaptic plasticity facilitation after therapeutic SD in MDD. The model proposes a novel framework for a mechanism of action of therapeutic SD that can be further tested in humans based on non-invasive indices and in animals based on direct studies of synaptic plasticity. Further determining the mechanisms of action of SD might contribute to the development of novel fast acting treatments for MDD, one of the major health problems worldwide.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Serotonergic psychedelics act as agonists at cortical 5-HT2A receptors and seem to induce personality changes. We conducted a systematic review of studies assessing the effects of these drugs on personality. Papers published from 1985-2016 were included from PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO databases. Three hundred and sixty-nine studies were identified, and 18 were included. Specific personality traits, such as Absorption and Self-Transcendence, seem to influence the effects of psychedelics, and psychedelic drug users and nonusers appear to differ in some personality traits. Psychedelics administered in controlled settings may induce personality changes, such as increased Openness and Self-Transcendence. Increases in global brain entropy induced by acute psychedelic administration predicted changes in Openness, and Self-Transcendence was negatively correlated with cortical thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex in long-term religious ayahuasca users. Acute and long-term use of psychedelics is associated with personality changes that appear to be modulated by 5-HT2A receptors. These changes seem to induce therapeutic effects that should be further explored in randomized controlled studies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

T1  - New medications for treatment-resistant depression: A brief review of recent developments
A1  - Thase M.E. 
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - There is a great unmet need for new medications with novel mechanisms of action that can effectively treat patients who do not benefit from standard antidepressant therapies. After a period in which it seemed as if the pharmaceutical pipeline for new antidepressants was going dry, the past decade has witnessed renewed interest, beginning with discovery of the antidepressant effects of ketamine. This article briefly highlights more recent research on ketamine and other investigational antidepressants.Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2018.

T1  - Antidepressant, Antipsychotic, and Hallucinogen Drugs for the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders: A Convergence at the Serotonin-2A Receptor
A1  - Howland R.H. 
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Antidepressant, atypical antipsychotic, and hallucinogen drugs mediate their actions in part by interactions with the serotonin-2A (5HT2A) receptor. Serotonergic hallucinogen drugs, such as psilocybin, bind most potently as agonists at the 5HT2A receptor, producing profound changes in perception, mood, and cognition. Some of these drugs have been or are currently being investigated in small Phase 2 studies for depression, alcoholism, smoking cessation, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. However, unlike the synergistic effects of combining antidepressant and atypical antipsychotic drugs, the potential therapeutic effects of hallucinogen drugs may be attenuated by the concurrent use of these medications because antidepressant and atypical antipsychotic drugs desensitize and/or down-regulate 5HT2A receptors. This finding has important implications for optimizing the potential therapeutic use of hallucinogen drugs in psychiatry. [Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services, 54(7), 21-24.].

T1  - Quality of acute psychedelic experience predicts therapeutic efficacy of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression
A1  - Roseman L.
A1  - Nutt D.J.
A1  - Carhart-Harris R.L. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Introduction: It is a basic principle of the "psychedelic" treatment model that the quality of the acute experience mediates long-term improvements in mental health. In the present paper we sought to test this using data from a clinical trial assessing psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In line with previous reports, we hypothesized that the occurrence and magnitude of Oceanic Boundlessness (OBN) (sharing features with mystical-type experience) and Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) (similar to anxiety) would predict long-term positive outcomes, whereas sensory perceptual effects would have negligible predictive value. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with treatment resistant depression underwent treatment with psilocybin (two separate sessions: 10 and 25 mg psilocybin). The Altered States of Consciousness (ASC) questionnaire was used to assess the quality of experiences in the 25 mg psilocybin session. From the ASC, the dimensions OBN and DED were used to measure the mystical-type and challenging experiences, respectively. The Self-Reported Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR) at 5 weeks served as the endpoint clinical outcome measure, as in later time points some of the subjects had gone on to receive new treatments, thus confounding inferences. In a repeated measure ANOVA, Time was the within-subject factor (independent variable), with QIDS-SR as the within-subject dependent variable in baseline, 1-day, 1-week, 5-weeks. OBN and DED were independent variables. OBN-by-Time and DED-by-Time interactions were the primary outcomes of interest. Results: For the interaction of OBN and DED with Time (QIDS-SR as dependent variable), the main effect and the effects at each time point compared to baseline were all significant (p = 0.002 and p = 0.003, respectively, for main effects), confirming our main hypothesis. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation of OBN with QIDS-SR (5 weeks) was specific compared to perceptual dimensions of the ASC (p < 0.05). Discussion: This report further bolsters the view that the quality of the acute psychedelic experience is a key mediator of long-term changes in mental health. Future therapeutic work with psychedelics should recognize the essential importance of quality of experience in determining treatment efficacy and consider ways of enhancing mystical-type experiences and reducing anxiety.Copyright © 2018 Roseman, Nutt and Carhart-Harris.

N2  - Background: The use of psychotropic drugs, namely those with an antidepressant profile (ADs), is a mandatory part of an integrated treatment of psychiatric disorders among cancer patients. We aimed to synthetize the most relevant data emerging from published studies to provide tips about the use of ADs in oncology. Design: A search was made of the major databases over the last 30 years (Embase/Medline, PsycLIT, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library), including narrative reviews, systematic reviews and meta-analyses summarizing the results from observational studies and randomized clinical trials assessing effectiveness, safety profile, interactions, contraindications and use of ADs in oncology with regard to both psychiatric (depressive spectrum, stress-related, anxiety disorders) and cancer-related symptoms (e.g. pain, hot flashes and fatigue). Results: The weight of evidence supports the efficacy of ADs for more severe major depression in individuals with cancer and as an adjuvant treatment in cancer-related symptoms, although the methodological limitations of reported randomized controlled trials do not permit definite conclusions. Data also indicate that there should be caution in the use of ADs in cancer patients in terms of their safety profile and potential clinically significant interactions with other prescribed medications. Practical recommendations that have been made for the use of ADs in cancer patients, in the context of a multimodal approach to depression treatment, have been summarized here. Conclusions: ADs are a relatively safe and effective treatment for more severe major depression in cancer patients. However, more research is urgently needed regarding the efficacy of ADs in different cancer types and cancer settings, their interactions with anticancer agents and their additive benefit when integrated with psychosocial interventions.Copyright © The Author 2017.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Salvinorin-A is a terpene found in the leaves of the plant Salvia divinorum. When administered to humans, salvinorin-A induces an intense but short-lasting modified state of awareness, sharing features with those induced by the classical serotonin-2A receptor agonist psychedelics. However, unlike substances such as psilocybin or mescaline, salvinorin-A shows agonist activity at the kappa-opioid receptor rather than at the serotonin-2A receptor. Here, we assessed the involvement of kappa-opioid receptor and serotonin-2A agonism in the subjective, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine effects of salvinorin-A in humans., METHODS: We conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study with 2 groups of 12 healthy volunteers with experience with psychedelic drugs. There were 4 experimental sessions. In group 1, participants received the following treatment combinations: placebo+placebo, placebo+salvinorin-A, naltrexone+placebo, and naltrexone+salvinorin-A. Naltrexone, a nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist, was administered at a dose of 50mg orally. In group 2, participants received the treatment combinations: placebo+placebo, placebo+salvinorin-A, ketanserin+placebo, and ketanserin+salvinorin-A. Ketanserin, a selective serotonin-2A antagonist, was administered at a dose of 40mg orally., RESULTS: Inhalation of 1mg of vaporized salvinorin-A led to maximum plasma concentrations at 1 and 2 minutes after dosing. When administered alone, salvinorin-A severely reduced external sensory perception and induced intense visual and auditory modifications, increased systolic blood pressure, and cortisol and prolactin release. These effects were effectively blocked by naltrexone, but not by ketanserin., CONCLUSIONS: Results support kappa opioid receptor agonism as the mechanism of action underlying the subjective and physiological effects of salvinorin-A in humans and rule out the involvement of a serotonin-2A-mediated mechanism.Copyright © The Author 2016.

N2  - The Motherisk Alcohol and Substance Use Helpline at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, is a unique telephone service providing evidence-based information on the negative effects associated with alcohol and substance use in pregnancy and lactation. We describe the characteristics of the service, the demographics of the callers, and the inquiries made during its first ten years of service. Since its inception in November 1998 until November 2008, almost 20,000 calls had been received with 60% of calls initiated by pregnant and breastfeeding women, the remainder from various health care providers. Most women exposed to alcohol and substances were of Caucasian descent (80%), employed (65%), and married (46%) with some level of post-secondary education (52%). The demographics of the callers deviate from the well-documented cohort of women at risk of engaging in alcohol and substance use in pregnancy and lactation, confirming that a selective group of women is more likely to use the services offered by the Motherisk program. Thus, further efforts are required to reach out to the subgroup of women at high risk of continuing their harmful behaviors during pregnancy and lactation. © 2010 Canadian Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

N2  - Drug abuse is a serious problem worldwide. Recently, hallucinogens have been reported as a potential preventative and auxiliary therapy for substance abuse. However, the use of hallucinogens as a drug abuse treatment has potential risks, as the fundamental mechanisms of hallucinogens are not clear. So far, no scientific database is available for the mechanism research of hallucinogens. We constructed a hallucinogen-specific chemogenomics database by collecting chemicals, protein targets and pathways closely related to hallucinogens. This information, together with our established computational chemogenomics tools, such as TargetHunter and HTDocking, provided a one-step solution for the mechanism study of hallucinogens. We chose salvinorin A, a potent hallucinogen extracted from the plant Salvia divinorum, as an example to demonstrate the usability of our platform. With the help of HTDocking program, we predicted four novel targets for salvinorin A, including muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 2, cannabinoid receptor 1, cannabinoid receptor 2 and dopamine receptor 2. We looked into the interactions between salvinorin A and the predicted targets. The binding modes, pose and docking scores indicate that salvinorin A may interact with some of these predicted targets. Overall, our database enriched the information of systems pharmacological analysis, target identification and drug discovery for hallucinogens.Copyright © 2016

N2  - Criminal behavior exacts a large toll on society and is resistant to intervention. Some evidence suggests classic psychedelics may inhibit criminal behavior, but the extent of these effects has not been comprehensively explored. In this study, we tested the relationships of classic psychedelic use and psilocybin use per se with criminal behavior among over 480,000 United States adult respondents pooled from the last 13 available years of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2002 through 2014) while controlling for numerous covariates. Lifetime classic psychedelic use was associated with a reduced odds of past year larceny/theft (aOR = 0.73 (0.65-0.83)), past year assault (aOR = 0.88 (0.80-0.97)), past year arrest for a property crime (aOR = 0.78 (0.65-0.95)), and past year arrest for a violent crime (aOR = 0.82 (0.70-0.97)). In contrast, lifetime illicit use of other drugs was, by and large, associated with an increased odds of these outcomes. Lifetime classic psychedelic use, like lifetime illicit use of almost all other substances, was associated with an increased odds of past year drug distribution. Results were consistent with a protective effect of psilocybin for antisocial criminal behavior. These findings contribute to a compelling rationale for the initiation of clinical research with classic psychedelics, including psilocybin, in forensic settings.Copyright © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

N2  - Psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences with participant-attributed increases in well-being. However, little research has examined enduring changes in traits. This study administered psilocybin to participants who undertook a program of meditation/spiritual practices. Healthy participants were randomized to three groups (25 each): (1) very low-dose (1 mg/70 kg on sessions 1 and 2) with moderate-level ("standard") support for spiritual-practice (LD-SS); (2) high-dose (20 and 30 mg/70 kg on sessions 1 and 2, respectively) with standard support (HD-SS); and (3) high-dose (20 and 30 mg/70kg on sessions 1 and 2, respectively) with high support for spiritual practice (HD-HS). Psilocybin was administered double-blind and instructions to participants/staff minimized expectancy confounds. Psilocybin was administered 1 and 2 months after spiritual-practice initiation. Outcomes at 6 months included rates of spiritual practice and persisting effects of psilocybin. Compared with low-dose, high-dose psilocybin produced greater acute and persisting effects. At 6 months, compared with LD-SS, both high-dose groups showed large significant positive changes on longitudinal measures of interpersonal closeness, gratitude, life meaning/purpose, forgiveness, death transcendence, daily spiritual experiences, religious faith and coping, and community observer ratings. Determinants of enduring effects were psilocybin-occasioned mystical-type experience and rates of meditation/spiritual practices. Psilocybin can occasion enduring trait-level increases in prosocial attitudes/behaviors and in healthy psychological functioning.Copyright © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

N2  - Research on psychedelics and of their clinical utilization has been evolving separately from placebo research. There are several parallels between this two research fields with possible mutual enrichment. Substantial role of extrapharmacological variables in psychedelic interventions has implications for next research and for potential regulation of such psychedelic intervention as healthcare service.

T1  - Receptor interaction profiles of novel psychoactive tryptamines compared with classic hallucinogens

N2  - The present study investigated interactions between the novel psychoactive tryptamines DiPT, 4-OH-DiPT, 4-OH-MET, 5-MeO-AMT, and 5-MeO-MiPT at monoamine receptors and transporters compared with the classic hallucinogens lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and mescaline. We investigated binding affinities at human monoamine receptors and determined functional serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptor activation. Binding at and the inhibition of human monoamine uptake transporters and transporter-mediated monoamine release were also determined. All of the novel tryptamines interacted with 5-HT2A receptors and were partial or full 5-HT2A agonists. Binding affinity to the 5-HT2A receptor was lower for all of the tryptamines, including psilocin and DMT, compared with LSD and correlated with the reported psychoactive doses in humans. Several tryptamines, including psilocin, DMT, DiPT, 4-OH-DiPT, and 4-OH-MET, interacted with the serotonin transporter and partially the norepinephrine transporter, similar to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine but in contrast to LSD and mescaline. LSD but not the tryptamines interacted with adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. In conclusion, the receptor interaction profiles of the tryptamines predict hallucinogenic effects that are similar to classic serotonergic hallucinogens but also MDMA-like psychoactive properties.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP

N2  - Descriptions of the use of natural products in traditional medicine have served as starting points for new therapeutics. The details of the traditional use of these organisms can provide important information for future drug discovery and development efforts. Recent technologic advances provide the framework to leverage ethnopharmacologic data in the drug discovery process. Information on the traditional harvest, preparation, storage, and administration of the organisms, and the natural products they contain, provides valuable details regarding characteristics of the active compounds. Importantly, researchers can now rapidly analyze and identify the multiple, and often synergistic, compounds contained in these natural products. Although we are entering the acme of ethnopharmacology, where information regarding the traditional use of organisms can provide valuable natural product leads and accelerate the identification of new therapeutics, this ethnopharmacologic resource is threatened by the loss of traditional medicine knowledge and extinction of organisms.Copyright © 2018 by Annual Reviews.

N2  - Acute and enduring adverse effects of psilocybin have been reported anecdotally, but have not been well characterized. For this study, 1993 individuals (mean age 30 yrs; 78% male) completed an online survey about their single most psychologically difficult or challenging experience (worst "bad trip") after consuming psilocybin mushrooms. Thirty-nine percent rated it among the top five most challenging experiences of his/her lifetime. Eleven percent put self or others at risk of physical harm; factors increasing the likelihood of risk included estimated dose, duration and difficulty of the experience, and absence of physical comfort and social support. Of the respondents, 2.6% behaved in a physically aggressive or violent manner and 2.7% received medical help. Of those whose experience occurred >1 year before, 7.6% sought treatment for enduring psychological symptoms. Three cases appeared associated with onset of enduring psychotic symptoms and three cases with attempted suicide. Multiple regression analysis showed degree of difficulty was positively associated, and duration was negatively associated, with enduring increases in well-being. Difficulty of experience was positively associated with dose. Despite difficulties, 84% endorsed benefiting from the experience. The incidence of risky behavior or enduring psychological distress is extremely low when psilocybin is given in laboratory studies to screened, prepared, and supported participants.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).

N2  - Unipolar mood disorders, including major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), confer high rates of disability and mortality and a very high socioeconomic burden. Current treatment is suboptimal in most cases and there is little of note in the pharmaceutical development pipeline. The psychedelic drugs, including lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin, were used extensively in the treatment of mood disorders, and other psychiatric conditions, before their prohibition in the late 1960s. They are relatively safe when used in medically controlled environments, with no reported risk of dependence. Here, we present a systematic review of published clinical treatment studies using psychedelics in patients with broadly defined UMD, and consider their place in psychiatry. Whilst all of the included studies have methodological shortcomings, of 423 individuals in 19 studies, 335 (79.2%) showed clinician-judged improvement after treatment with psychedelics. A recently completed pilot study in the UK favours the use of psilocybin with psychological support in treatment resistant depressive disorder. The evidence overall strongly suggests that psychedelics should be re-examined in modern clinical trials for their use in unipolar mood disorders and other non-psychotic mental health conditions.Copyright © British Association for Psychopharmacology.

N2  - Acute adverse psychological reactions to classic hallucinogens ("bad trips" or "challenging experiences"), while usually benign with proper screening, preparation, and support in controlled settings, remain a safety concern in uncontrolled settings (such as illicit use contexts). Anecdotal and case reports suggest potential adverse acute symptoms including affective (panic, depressed mood), cognitive (confusion, feelings of losing sanity), and somatic (nausea, heart palpitation) symptoms. Responses to items from several hallucinogen-sensitive questionnaires (Hallucinogen Rating Scale, the States of Consciousness Questionnaire, and the Five-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire) in an Internet survey of challenging experiences with the classic hallucinogen psilocybin were used to construct and validate a Challenging Experience Questionnaire. The stand-alone Challenging Experience Questionnaire was then validated in a separate sample. Seven Challenging Experience Questionnaire factors (grief, fear, death, insanity, isolation, physical distress, and paranoia) provide a phenomenological profile of challenging aspects of experiences with psilocybin. Factor scores were associated with difficulty, meaningfulness, spiritual significance, and change in well-being attributed to the challenging experiences. The factor structure did not differ based on gender or prior struggle with anxiety or depression. The Challenging Experience Questionnaire provides a basis for future investigation of predictors and outcomes of challenging experiences with classic hallucinogens.Copyright © The Author(s) 2016.

N2  - Cancer patients often develop chronic, clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes.

N2  - Background: Clinically significant anxiety and depression are common in patients with cancer, and are associated with poor psychiatric and medical outcomes. Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin to treat cancer-related anxiety and depression. Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 29 patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned and received treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or niacin, both in conjunction with psychotherapy. The primary outcomes were anxiety and depression assessed between groups prior to the crossover at 7 weeks. Results: Prior to the crossover, psilocybin produced immediate, substantial, and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression and led to decreases in cancer-related demoralization and hopelessness, improved spiritual wellbeing, and increased quality of life. At the 6.5-month follow-up, psilocybin was associated with enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects (approximately 60-80% of participants continued with clinically significant reductions in depression or anxiety), sustained benefits in existential distress and quality of life, as well as improved attitudes towards death. The psilocybin-induced mystical experience mediated the therapeutic effect of psilocybin on anxiety and depression. Conclusions: In conjunction with psychotherapy, single moderate-dose psilocybin produced rapid, robust and enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects in patients with cancer-related psychological distress.

T1  - Effects of the classic hallucinogen psilocybin and the dissociative hallucinogen dextromethorphan on cognition

N2  - Background: Classic hallucinogens (serotonin 2 A receptor agonists) and dissociative hallucinogens (NMDA receptor antagonists) have a wide range of neuropsychological effects. Drugs of both classes are being pursued as novel treatments for mood disorders. While classic and dissociative hallucinogens have different pharmacologic mechanisms of action, they may have similar subjective and neuropsychological effects. The objective of this double-blind, placebo controlled crossover study was to compare the neuropsychological effects of multiple doses of the classic hallucinogen psilocybin with the effects of a single high dose of the dissociative hallucinogen dextromethorphan. Methods: Twenty hallucinogen users (11 F, 9M) completed five drug administration sessions lasting 6 to 8 hours each. During each session, volunteers self-administered capsules containing placebo, one of three doses (10, 20, and 30 mg/ 70 kg) of psilocybin, or a dose dextromethorphan (DXM; 400 mg/70 kg). Dose order was counter-balanced across volunteers using a 5-order Williams design. Before capsule administration and at peak drug effect, volunteers were assessed for overall cognitive impairment using the Mini- Mental State Examination. Computerized neuropsychological tasks measuring psychomotor performance (the Motor Praxis test), working (the Letter N-Back test) and episodic memory (word encoding, recall, and recognition), executive function and associative learning (the Digit Symbol Substitution Task, or DSST), and visual perception (the Penn Line Orientation Task, or PLOT) were assessed at various points throughout the timecourse of drug effects. The DSST and episodic memory tasks were programmed within the Presentation software package. The Motor Praxis, Letter N-Back, and PLOT tasks were administered as part of the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB). Multiple task forms were administered in order to minimize learning effects. Task order was counterbalanced across participants, and orthogonalized in relation to dose order. Outcome measures for each task were analyzed using a mixed-effects repeated measures ANCOVA using the lmer function of the lme4 library and the lmerTest library within the R statistical environment. Responses were nested within subject, testing a main effect of drug condition and using average mpraxis response times for the given assessment period as a covariate to control for general effects of psychomotor slowing on performance of each task. For the DSST and Letter N-Back analyses, responses were also nested within drug condition and a main effect of time point (for the DSST) or task condition (for the Letter N-Back) was included, as DSST was assessed at multiple timepoints within each session, and the Letter N-Back contained multiple task conditions. Results: Overall cognitive impairment, as assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination, was not observed with psilocybin or DXM. Orderly and dose-dependent effects of psilocybin were observed, and consisted of impairments of psychomotor performance, working memory, episodic memory, associative learning, and visual perception. Effects of a high dose of DXM were observed, and consisted of impairments of psychomotor performance, working memory, visual perception, and associative learning that were in the range of effects of a moderate to high dose (20 to 30 mg/ 70 kg) of psilocybin. Psilocybin had greater effects than DXM on measures of working memory. DXM had greater effects than all doses of psilocybin on measures of word recognition sensitivity, response inhibition, and executive control. Conclusions: Psilocybin exerted selective effects on working memory, whereas DXM selective effects on episodic memory, response inhibition, and executive control. Notably, this is the first time that dose-dependent effects of psilocybin were demonstrated for measures related to verbal working memory, episodic memory, and executive function. Future studies should determine whether any of these component processes of cognition are necessary, sufficient, or supportive of therapeutic outcomes associated with classic psychedelics or dissociative hallucinogens.

N2  - Rationale: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is used recreationally and in clinical research. Acute mystical-type experiences that are acutely induced by hallucinogens are thought to contribute to their potential therapeutic effects. However, no data have been reported on LSD-induced mystical experiences and their relationship to alterations of consciousness. Additionally, LSD dose- and concentration-response functions with regard to alterations of consciousness are lacking. Methods: We conducted two placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over studies using oral administration of 100 and 200 mug LSD in 24 and 16 subjects, respectively. Acute effects of LSD were assessed using the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) scale after both doses and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) after 200 mug. Results: On the MEQ, 200 mug LSD induced mystical experiences that were comparable to those in patients who underwent LSD-assisted psychotherapy but were fewer than those reported for psilocybin in healthy subjects or patients. On the 5D-ASC scale, LSD produced higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed meaning of percepts after 200 mug compared with 100 mug. Plasma levels of LSD were not positively correlated with its effects, with the exception of ego dissolution at 100 mug. Conclusions: Mystical-type experiences were infrequent after LSD, possibly because of the set and setting used in the present study. LSD may produce greater or different alterations of consciousness at 200 mug (i.e., a dose that is currently used in psychotherapy in Switzerland) compared with 100 mug (i.e., a dose used in imaging studies). Ego dissolution may reflect plasma levels of LSD, whereas more robustly induced effects of LSD may not result in such associations.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).

N2  - Psychedelic drugs, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline, and psilocybin, exert profound effects on brain and behavior. After decades of difficulties in studying these compounds, psychedelics are again being tested as potential treatments for intractable biomedical disorders. Preclinical research of psychedelics complements human neuroimaging studies and pilot clinical trials, suggesting these compounds as promising treatments for addiction, depression, anxiety, and other conditions. However, many questions regarding the mechanisms of action, safety, and efficacy of psychedelics remain. Here, we summarize recent preclinical and clinical data in this field, discuss their pharmacological mechanisms of action, and outline critical areas for future studies of psychedelic drugs, with the goal of maximizing the potential benefits of translational psychedelic biomedicine to patients. Psychedelic drugs profoundly alter human behavior, acting primarily via agonism at the 5-HT2A receptor in the brain. Research into the mechanisms of psychedelic drugs is experiencing a renaissance after years of stagnation. Animal models show that psychedelic drugs alter a number of crucial molecular mechanisms. Psychedelic drugs cause widespread changes in cognition and brain connectivity. Recent pilot studies show LSD and psilocybin are effective in treating psychiatric disorders and possibly other illnesses. Psychedelic biomedicine is rapidly emerging as an important area of translational research.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Hallucinogen-persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a syndrome characterized by prolonged or reoccurring perceptual symptoms, reminiscent of acute hallucinogen effects. HPPD was associated with a broader range of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide)-like substances, cannabis, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), psilocybin, mescaline, and psychostimulants. The recent emergence of novel psychoactive substances (NPS) posed a critical concern regarding the new onset of psychiatric symptoms/syndromes, including cases of HPPD. Symptomatology mainly comprises visual disorders (i.e., geometric pseudo-hallucinations, haloes, flashes of colors/lights, motion-perception deficits, afterimages, micropsia, more acute awareness of floaters, etc.), even though depressive symptoms and thought disorders may be comorbidly present. Although HPPD was first described in 1954, it was just established as a fully syndrome in 2000, with the revised fourth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). HPPD neural substrates, risk factors, and aetiopathogenesys still largely remain unknown and under investigation, and many questions about its pharmacological targets remain unanswered too. A critical mini review on psychopathological bases, etiological hypothesis, and psychopharmacological approaches toward HPPD, including the association with some novel substances, are provided here, by means of a literature search on PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases without time restrictions, by using a specific set of keywords. Pharmacological and clinical issues are considered, and practical psychopharmacological recommendations and clinical guidelines are suggested.Copyright © 2017 Orsolini, Papanti, De Berardis, Guirguis, Corkery and Schifano.

N2  - Rationale: Stimulation of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and related compounds such as psilocybin has previously been shown to increase primary process thinking - an ontologically and evolutionary early, implicit, associative, and automatic mode of thinking which is typically occurring during altered states of consciousness such as dreaming. However, it is still largely unknown whether LSD induces primary process thinking under placebo-controlled, standardized experimental conditions and whether these effects are related to subjective experience and 5-HT2A receptor activation. Therefore, this study aimed to test the hypotheses that LSD increases primary process thinking and that primary process thinking depends on 5-HT2A receptor activation and is related to subjective drug effects. Methods: Twenty-five healthy subjects performed an audio-recorded mental imagery task 7 h after drug administration during three drug conditions: placebo, LSD (100 mcg orally) and LSD together with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg orally). The main outcome variable in this study was primary index (PI), a formal measure of primary process thinking in the imagery reports. State of consciousness was evaluated using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) rating scale. Results: LSD, compared with placebo, significantly increased primary index (p < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected). The LSD-induced increase in primary index was positively correlated with LSD-induced disembodiment (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected), and blissful state (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected) on the 5D-ASC. Both LSD-induced increases in primary index and changes in state of consciousness were fully blocked by ketanserin. Conclusion: LSD induces primary process thinking via activation of 5-HT2A receptors and in relation to disembodiment and blissful state. Primary process thinking appears to crucially organize inner experiences during both dreams and psychedelic states of consciousness.Copyright © 2017 Kraehenmann, Pokorny, Aicher, Preller, Pokorny, Bosch, Seifritz and Vollenweider.

N2  - The history of neuroleptics is only the emerging part of an iceberg of research, the birth of Psychopharmacology in France, several episodes of which are less known or forgotten. In this article, the author describes the experiments of psychodysleptics (mescaline, LSD25 and psilocybin), from 1950 to 1967, at Hopital Sainte-Anne in the Department of Psychiatry University of Jean-Delay. These experiments were intended as "clinical trials" aimed at psychological and psychotherapeutic research. This article refers to a period in the history of psychiatry, between the disappearance of classical medical self-experimentation and the birth of Psychopharmacology, between the publication of the Nuremberg Code (1948) and the voting of the law of 31, December 1970, on Addictions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS

T1  - Poisoning with illicit drugs
A1  - Anderson M. 
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - It is estimated that approximately one quarter of adults in the European Union will have used illicit drugs at some point in their lifetime for recreational purposes. Cannabis is the most commonly used drugs by a significant margin. Illicit drug use in younger teenagers appears to have fallen in the UK over the last 10 years. However the level of use in 16-19 year olds remains one of the highest compared with other age groups, with hospital admission due to poisoning also common in this group. Assessment and management of the young person with evidence of toxicity due to illicit drugs is based upon meticulous attention to resuscitation and supportive care, combined with risk assessment dependent upon the suspected causative drug. Good knowledge of the pharmacology of the implicated drug allows early identification and avoidance of complications.Copyright © 2017

N2  - The discovery of a "new" psychoactive substance is a relatively exceptional event, while the regulatory response usually involved the assessment of risks to public health and inclusion of the novel substance in the national list of controlled substances. However, in recent years we have witnessed the rapid emergence of new chemical substances, which elude international control and pose a challenge to existing processes and a threat to the credibility of control systems. We currently review and present characteristics of these legal and illegal new substances and issues regarding their global monitoring and regulatory measures already taken, or in the process of being taken, for their control. The concept of prohibition applied in active substance-related legislation is rather hazard ridden as balance is required between the ban on substances of potential therapeutic use and the access on the market of high-risk substances.

N2  - Current understanding of the neurobiology of depression has grown over the past few years beyond the traditional monoamine theory of depression to include chronic stress, inflammation and disrupted synaptic plasticity. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a key factor that not only promotes fibrinolysis via the activation of plasminogen, but also contributes to regulation of synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis through plasmin-mediated activation of a probrain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to mature BDNF. ProBDNF activation could potentially be supressed by competition with fibrin for plasmin and tPA. High affinity binding of plasmin and tPA to fibrin could result in a decrease of proBDNF activation during brain inflammation leading to fibrosis further perpetuating depressed mood. There is a paucity of data explaining the possible role of the fibrinolytic system or aberrant extravascular fibrin deposition in depression. We propose that within the brain, an imbalance between tPA and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and neuroserpin favors the inhibitors, resulting in changes in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neuroinflammation that result in depressive behavior. Our hypothesis is that peripheral inflammation mediates neuroinflammation, and that cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) can inhibit the fibrinolytic system by up- regulating PAI-1 and potentially neuroserpin. We propose that the decrement of the activity of tPA and uPA occurs with downregulation of uPA in part involving the binding and clearance from the surface of neural cells of uPA/PAI-1 complexes by the urokinase receptor uPAR. We infer that current antidepressants and ketamine mitigate depressive symptoms by restoring the balance of the fibrinolytic system with increased activity of tPA and uPA with down-regulated intracerebral expression of their inhibitors. We lastly hypothesize that psychedelic 5-ht2a receptor agonists, such as psilocybin, can improve mood through anti- inflammatory and pro-fibrinolytic effects that include blockade of TNF-alpha activity leading to decreased PAI-1 activity and increased clearance. The process involves disinhibition of tPA and uPA with subsequent increased cleavage of proBDNF which promotes neurogenesis, decreased neuroinflammation, decreased fibrin deposition, normalized glial-neuronal cross-talk, and optimally functioning neuro-circuits involved in mood. We propose that psilocybin can alleviate deleterious changes in the brain caused by chronic stress leading to restoration of homeostatic brain fibrinolytic capacity leading to euthymia.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

T1  - Long-term follow-up of psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation
A1  - Johnson M.W.
A1  - Garcia-Romeu A.
A1  - Griffiths R.R. 
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Background: A recent open-label pilot study (N = 15) found that two to three moderate to high doses (20 and 30 mg/70 kg) of the serotonin 2A receptor agonist, psilocybin, in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation, resulted in substantially higher 6-month smoking abstinence rates than are typically observed with other medications or CBT alone. Objectives: To assess long-term effects of a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation program at >=12 months after psilocybin administration. Methods: The present report describes biologically verified smoking abstinence outcomes of the previous pilot study at >=12 months, and related data on subjective effects of psilocybin. Results: All 15 participants completed a 12-month follow-up, and 12 (80%) returned for a long-term (>=16 months) follow-up, with a mean interval of 30 months (range = 16-57 months) between target-quit date (i.e., first psilocybin session) and long-term follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, 10 participants (67%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At long-term follow-up, nine participants (60%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At 12-month follow-up 13 participants (86.7%) rated their psilocybin experiences among the five most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of their lives. Conclusion: These results suggest that in the context of a structured treatment program, psilocybin holds considerable promise in promoting long-term smoking abstinence. The present study adds to recent and historical evidence suggesting high success rates when using classic psychedelics in the treatment of addiction. Further research investigating psilocybin-facilitated treatment of substance use disorders is warranted.Copyright © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

T1  - Medications development for the treatment of alcohol use disorder: insights into the predictive value of animal and human laboratory models
A1  - Yardley M.M.
A1  - Ray L.A. 
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Development of effective treatments for alcohol use disorder (AUD) represents an important public health goal. This review provides a summary of completed preclinical and clinical studies testing pharmacotherapies for the treatment of AUD. We discuss opportunities for improving the translation from preclinical findings to clinical trial outcomes, focusing on the validity and predictive value of animal and human laboratory models of AUD. Specifically, while preclinical studies of medications development have offered important insights into the neurobiology of the disorder and alcohol's molecular targets, limitations include the lack of standardized methods and streamlined processes whereby animal studies can readily inform human studies. Behavioral pharmacology studies provide a less expensive and valuable opportunity to assess the feasibility of a pharmacotherapy prior to initiating larger scale clinical trials by providing insights into the mechanism of the drug, which can then inform recruitment, analyses, and assessments. Summary tables are provided to illustrate the wide range of preclinical, human laboratory, and clinical studies of medications development for alcoholism. Taken together, this review highlights the challenges associated with animal paradigms, human laboratory studies, and clinical trials with the overarching goal of advancing treatment development and highlighting opportunities to bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical research.Copyright © 2016 Society for the Study of Addiction

N2  - Introduction: Evidence based treatment for Substance use disorders (SUD) includes psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. However, these are only partially effective. Hallucinogens, such as psilocybin, may represent potential new treatment options for SUD. This review provides a summary of (human) studies on the putative therapeutic effects of psilocybin, and discusses the receptor systems, brain regions and cognitive and emotional processes mediating psilocybin's effects. Psilocybin's chemical structure is similar to that of serotonin. Dysregulations in the serotonin system are associated with alterations in stress hormones, such as cortisol, and mood disorders. After psilocybin administration cortisol levels spike and activate the executive control network, with subsequent increased control over emotional processes, and relief of negative thinking and persistent negative emotions. Preliminary data of ongoing alcohol and smoking addiction studies in humans shows promising effects of psilocybin administration on substance use. Importantly, psilocybin has a low risk of toxicity and dependence and can be used safely under controlled clinical conditions. Areas covered: This paper is a narrative review based on the search terms: psilocybin, substance use disorder, addiction, depression, serotonin. Literature on potential efficacy and mechanisms of action of psilocybin in SUD is discussed. Expert commentary: Recent positive findings with psilocybin need confirmation in well-designed placebo controlled randomized trials employing a large sample size.Copyright © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Introduction: Comorbidity is a term defined as the presence of two or more conditions occurring either at the same time or having a close relationship to the same individual. World Health Organization (WHO) define it as the "co-occurrence in the same individual of a psychoactive substance use disorder and another psychiatric disorder". Progressive deinstitutionalisation, despite indisputable benefits and improvement of life quality in psychiatric patients, resulted in appearance of new burdens, such as deterioration of family life. Furthermore, wide availability of alcoholic beverages and drugs in communities where the patients live, led comorbid substance abuse disorders to emerge as one of the biggest challenges in the modern psychiatry. There is a limited amount of data concerning the background of the patients with a dual diagnosis, available in the literature, and therefore our aim was to create a sociodemographic profile of such individuals. Materials and methods: The study was conducted among the patients treated in a drug rehabilitation centre of the Upper Silesian Association "Familia" in Gliwice, Poland using authors' own questionnaire, consisting of 75 items. The study group consisted of 9 females and 91 males (n=100), average age of the patients equalled 29.7 years (95%CI: 28.5-31 years; min/max value: 20/48 years), all the patients had an established dual diagnosis. Outcomes: 66% of the study group was single, with permanent residency, living with family either in city (47%) or in village (19%). Remaining 34% was spread through the other options (1-4%), with the highest percentage in "single, with permanent residency, living alone in the city" (4%). Conclusions: Obtained data, demonstrated high homogeneity among the patients with a dual diagnosis in terms of a sociodemographical profile.Copyright © 2017 Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia.

N2  - Medicinal plants are used in the treatment of different ailments. They cannot be distinguished from other plants by morphological characteristics except their pharmacological effects and contain therapeutic agents. Non-medicinal plants are morphologically similar to medicinal plants except some of the members produce active compounds that function either as poisons, pesticides, hallucinogens or teratogens. Poisonous plants produce poison, and pesticide plants are useful in pestmanagement. Poisons and pesticides cause injury, illness, or death to a person if he tastes, smells, and gets it on skin or in eye by their local or systematic action or both. However, the boundary line between medicinal and non-medicinal poisonous, pesticide, hallucinogen plants, etc., is not sharply demarcated, e.g., Azadirachta indica, Malus sp., Prunus spp., Manihot esculenta, Abrus precatorius, Brugmansia sp., Cicuta douglasii, Colchicum autumnale, Datura spp., Digitalis purpurea, Nepenthes attenboroughii, Nerium oleander, Ricinus communis, Strophanthus gratus, Strychnos nux-vomica contain different bioactive compounds including azadirachtin, nimbin, amygdalin, linamarin, and lotaustralin (cyanogenic glycoside), abrin, ricin (ribosome-inactivating protein), aconitine (alkaloid), scopolamine, hyoscyamine, atropine (tropane alkaloids), solanine (glycoalkaloid), nerioside, oleandroside, ouabain (cardiac glycoside); saponins, strychnine (extremely bitter deadly alkaloid), etc. which may be used either as drug principles or poisons or toxins depending on dose and intention of use. Plant-derived pesticides like pyrethrin, rotenone, nicotine, strychnine, and scilliroside from Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium, Pachyrhizus erosus, Nicotina tabacum, S. nux-vomica, Drimia maritime, respectively, are widely used. Hallucinogens are psychoactive agents of natural origin and cause distortions in perceptions of reality (hallucinations) by disrupting the interaction of nerve cells and the neurotransmitter serotonin. Hallucinogens are mostly alkaloids, and mescaline, psilocin, psilocybin, ibogaine, LSD, etc. are some of the examples of common hallucinogen drugs. Topically active hallucinogens include solanaceous belladonna, henbane, mandrake, datura. Pollen from hundreds of weed, grass, and tree plant species, e.g., ragweed, maple, oak, Acacia, Bermuda grass, castor bean, red clover can trigger allergic reactions (allerginosis) in many people every year. Teratogens affect the development of an embryo, pregnancy or may cause a birth defect in the child. Diverse group of compounds, e.g., vitamin D, quinine, anagyrine, and other alkaloids aspirin, marijuana, cannabinols, etc., have shown teratogenicity compounds are synthesized by different plant of the genera including Lupinus, Veratrum, Conium, Astragalus, Nicotiana, Trachymene, Datura, Prunus, Sorghum, Senecio. Some of these plants also cause congenital defects. Natural color and dyes are obtained from plants, animals, or minerals without chemical processing. Roots, berries, bark, leaves, and wood of plants, as well as fungi and lichens, are the major natural sources. Many of the natural dyes like turmeric, annatto, and saffron are food additives and some have pharmacological effects and possible health benefits. The pharmacological effects of medicinal plants are mainly due to their secondary metabolites (e.g., alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolics, glycosides, antibiotics.) produced in the secondary metabolic pathways, which are often species specific, i.e., found in only a small set of species in a narrow phylogenetic group while the primary metabolic pathways and primary metabolites (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and others) are ubiquitous in plant species. Innumerable numbers of medicinal herbs or their active therapeutic secondary metabolites are used in both traditional and modern systems of medicines. The secondary metabolites may be grouped as nitrogenous (e.g., alkaloids, non-protein amino acids, amines, cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates.) and non-nitrogenous (e.g., terpenoids, steroids, saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, polyacetylenes, polyketides, phenylpropanoids.) metabolites. Therapeutically important alkaloids include morphine and codeine from the opium poppy, cocaine from the coca plant, atropine from the deadly nightshade Belladonna, vincristine and vinblastine from the periwinkle, quinine from the bark of the cinchona, caffeine from coffee, tea, and cola plants, nicotine is present in tobacco. Monoterpenes are exemplified by the aromatic oils (e.g., menthol) contained in the leaves of some members of mint family, and pyrethroids are present in the flowers of Chrysanthemum; diterpenes paclitaxel (taxol) is found in bark of the Pacific yew tree; triterpenoids (plant steroids) phytoecdysones are a group of plant sterols are obtained from Tinospora, Asparagus; tetraterpenoids include important pigments (e.g., beta-carotene, lycopene) and are available in colored plant parts. Salicylic acid, a simple phenolic compound, can be obtained from the bark of white willow (Salix alba); isoflavones, lignin (complex phenolic macromolecule), anthocyanins, and anthocyanidins (phenolic pigments) impart pink and purple colors to flowers and fruits. Medicinal herbs include entire plant, plant parts, e.g., leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, wood, bark, roots, rhizomes, or other plant parts in entire, fragmented form as well as fresh juices, gums, fixed oils, essential oils, resins, etc. Herbal finished products include comminuted or powdered herbal materials, or extracts, tinctures, and fatty oils, and mixed herbal product. Finished and mixed herbal products may contain excipients in addition to the active ingredients. Herbal principles that have made valuable contribution to the development of modern medicine include ephedrine, digitoxin, salicin, reserpine, atropine, colchicine, quinine, codeine, vincristine, ipecac, physostigmine, sena, cocaine, capsaicin, scopolamine. Allamandin, helenalin, indicine-N-oxide, mezerien and laphacol, insulin effectors, boswellic acid, withanolides, ruscogenin, harpagoside, etc. are some therapeutically promising molecules identified recently from herbs. Artemisia annua provides new generation anti-malaria drug; bark of Prunus africana is useful for prostate cancer; Sutherlandia is important for its value to HIV/AIDS sufferers. Recent discovery like beta-adrenergic and paclitaxel from Lingusticum wallichii and Taxus brevifolia, respectively, signify the role of plant as an inexhaustible treasure of modern medicines. Different traditional systems of medicine including the (i) Traditional Chinese, (ii) Ayurvedic, (iii) Unani, (iv) Homeopathy, (v) Siddah, (vi) Native North American Herbal, (vii) Western Herbal, (viii) Yoga, (ix) Naturopathy, (x) Folk medicine have been using hundreds of medicinal plants and other accessories in diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and elimination of physical, mental, or social imbalance since antiquity. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a non-mainstream medicine consisting of a wide range of healthcare practices, products, and therapies, e.g., homeopathy, naturopathy, chiropractic, magnetic field therapy, energy medicine, various forms of acupuncture, Traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, Christian faith healing. Modern medicine is based on evidence and clinical proof and is practiced by medical graduates or postgraduates educated in medical college, institute, or university after completion of the prescribed medical curriculum in a stipulated period of time. Before the twentieth century, most medicines were extracted from plants (herbal medicines), and since the twentieth century, thousands of modern drugs have been synthesized from an organic compound. The active principles of herbal medicine are comparable with the contents of modern medicine, and many common drugs in use today were derived from herbal sources (e.g., aspirin from willow bark, digitalis from foxglove) and therefore, herbal medicine may not be considered as mere quackery. There are numerous advantages of herbal medicine including its effectiveness for long-standing health complaints irresponsive to traditional medicine, fewer side effects, safer to use over time, well tolerated by the patient(e.g., prescription drug vioxx-rofecoxib for arthritis was recalled due to increased risk of cardiovascular complications), inexpensive compared to modern drugs, and easy availability of herbs. However, herbal medicine and herbalist may not be proved effective for sudden, serious illnesses, serious trauma, appendicitis, or a heart attack as a conventional doctor using modern diagnostic tests, surgery, and drugs. Self-dosing with herbs, overdosing, misidentification of herbs from the wild source, interaction with prescription drugs, lack of quality assurance, etc. are some of the important disadvantages of herbal medicine.Copyright © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

N2  - The classical hallucinogens having an affinity towards 5HT2A receptors are discussed, along with their common behavioral effects, toxicity and psychiatric complications which could have long-Term consequences on individuals. A survey has been done on the various analytical methods used for determination and quantification of hallucinogens: colorimetrical reactions (Marquis, Ehrlich tests), gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (when the substances are not thermo labile), tandem mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection and JR spectroscopy. Methods most often used to analyze biological samples like urine, blood or plasma immunological methods for quick detection, which results are confirmed later by the other methods mentioned above have been also discussed.

T1  - Metabolism of psilocybin and psilocin: clinical and forensic toxicological relevance
A1  - Dinis-Oliveira R.J. 
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Psilocybin and psilocin are controlled substances in many countries. These are the two main hallucinogenic compounds of the "magic mushrooms" and both act as agonists or partial agonists at 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2A subtype receptors. During the last few years, psilocybin and psilocin have gained therapeutic relevance but considerable physiological variability between individuals that can influence dose-response and toxicological profile has been reported. This review aims to discuss metabolism of psilocybin and psilocin, by presenting all major and minor psychoactive metabolites. Psilocybin is primarily a pro-drug that is dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase to active metabolite psilocin. This last is then further metabolized, psilocin-O-glucuronide being the main urinary metabolite with clinical and forensic relevance in diagnosis.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Current suggestions for capacities that should be targeted for moral enhancement has centered on traits like empathy, fairness or aggression. The literature, however, lacks a proper model for understanding the interplay and complexity of moral capacities, which limits the practicability of proposed interventions. In this paper, I integrate some existing knowledge on the nature of human moral behavior and present a formal model of prosocial motivation. The model provides two important results regarding the most friction-free route to moral enhancement. First, we should consider decreasing self-interested motivation rather than increasing prosociality directly. Second, this should be complemented with cognitive enhancement. These suggestions are tested against existing and emerging evidence on cognitive capacity, mindfulness meditation and the effects of psychedelic drugs and are found to have sufficient grounding for further theoretical and empirical exploration. Furthermore, moral effects of the latter two are hypothesized to result from a diminished sense of self with subsequent reductions in self-interest.Copyright © 2017, The Author(s).

N2  - A feature of human culture is that we can learn to consume chemical compounds, derived from natural plants or synthetic fabrication, for their psychoactive effects. These drugs change the mental state and/or the behavioral performance of an individual and can be instrumentalized for various purposes. After the emergence of a novel psychoactive substance (NPS) and a period of experimental consumption, personal and medical benefits and harm potential of the NPS can be estimated on evidence base. This may lead to a legal classification of the NPS, which may range from limited medical use, controlled availability up to a complete ban of the drug form publically accepted use. With these measures, however, a drug does not disappear, but frequently continues to be used, which eventually allows an even better estimate of the drug's properties. Thus, only in rare cases, there is a final verdict that is no more questioned. Instead, the view on a drug can change from tolerable to harmful but may also involve the new establishment of a desired medical application to a previously harmful drug. Here, we provide a summary review on a number of NPS for which the neuropharmacological evaluation has made important progress in recent years. They include mitragynine ("Kratom"), synthetic cannabinoids (e.g., "Spice"), dimethyltryptamine and novel serotonergic hallucinogens, the cathinones mephedrone and methylone, ketamine and novel dissociative drugs, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, gamma-butyrolactone, and 1,4-butanediol. This review shows not only emerging harm potentials but also some potential medical applications.Copyright © 2017 Hassan, Bosch, Singh, Narayanan, Kasinather, Seifritz, Kornhuber, Quednow and Muller.

N2  - Scientific interest in serotonergic psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin and LSD; 5-HT2A receptor agonists) has dramatically increased within the last decade. Clinical studies administering psychedelics with psychotherapy have shown preliminary evidence of robust efficacy in treating anxiety and depression, as well as addiction to tobacco and alcohol. Moreover, recent research has suggested that these compounds have potential efficacy against inflammatory diseases through novel mechanisms, with potential advantages over existing antiinflammatory agents. We propose that psychedelics exert therapeutic effects for psychiatric disorders by acutely destabilizing local brain network hubs and global network connectivity via amplification of neuronal avalanches, providing the occasion for brain network "resetting" after the acute effects have resolved. Antiinflammatory effects may hold promise for efficacy in treatment of inflammation-related nonpsychiatric as well as potentially for psychiatric disorders. Serotonergic psychedelics operate through unique mechanisms that show promising effects for a variety of intractable, debilitating, and lethal disorders, and should be rigorously researched.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics

N2  - Introduction: The authors describe the medications for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in phase II/III of clinical development in the EU and USA and provide an opinion on how current treatment can be improved in the near future. Areas covered: Sixty-two trials were identified in US and EU clinical trial registries that included six investigational compounds in recent phase III development and 12 others in recent phase II clinical trials. Glutamatergic agents have been the focus of many studies. A single intravenous dose of the glutamatergic modulator ketamine produces a robust and rapid antidepressant effect in persons with TRD; this effect continues to remain significant for 1 week. This observation was a turning point that opened the way for other, more selective glutamatergic modulators (intranasal esketamine, AVP-786, AVP-923, AV-101, and rapastinel). Of the remaining compounds, monoclonal antibodies open highly innovative therapeutic options, based on new pathophysiological approaches to depression. Expert commentary: Promising new agents are emerging for TRD treatment. Glutamatergic modulators likely represent a very promising alternative to monoaminergic antidepressant monotherapy. We could see the arrival of the first robust and rapid acting antidepressant drug in the near future, which would strongly facilitate the ultimate goal of recovery in persons with TRD.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Psilocybin is a classic (serotonergic) hallucinogen ("psychedelic" drug) that may occasion mystical experiences (characterized by a profound feeling of oneness or unity) during acute effects. Such experiences may have therapeutic value. Research and clinical applications of psychedelics usually include music listening during acute drug effects, based on the expectation that music will provide psychological support during the acute effects of psychedelic drugs, and may even facilitate the occurrence of mystical experiences. However, the features of music chosen to support the different phases of drug effects are not well-specified. As a result, there is currently neither real guidance for the selection of music nor standardization of the music used to support clinical trials with psychedelic drugs across various research groups or therapists. A description of the features of music found to be supportive of mystical experience will allow for the standardization and optimization of the delivery of psychedelic drugs in both research trials and therapeutic contexts. To this end, we conducted an anonymous survey of individuals with extensive experience administering psilocybin or psilocybin-containing mushrooms under research or therapeutic conditions, in order to identify the features of commonly used musical selections that have been found by therapists and research staff to be supportive of mystical experiences within a psilocybin session. Ten respondents yielded 24 unique recommendations of musical stimuli supportive of peak effects with psilocybin, and 24 unique recommendations of musical stimuli supportive of the period leading up to a peak experience. Qualitative analysis (expert rating of musical and music-theoretic features of the recommended stimuli) and quantitative analysis (using signal processing and music-information retrieval methods) of 22 of these stimuli yielded a description of peak period music that was characterized by regular, predictable, formulaic phrase structure and orchestration, a feeling of continuous movement and forward motion that slowly builds over time, and lower perceptual brightness when compared to pre peak music. These results provide a description of music that may be optimally supportive of peak psychedelic experiences. This description can be used to guide the selection and composition of music for future psychedelic research and therapy sessions.Copyright © 2017 Barrett, Robbins, Smooke, Brown and Griffiths.

T1  - Looking for the self: Phenomenology, neurophysiology and philosophical significance of drug-induced ego dissolution
A1  - Milliere R. 
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - There is converging evidence that high doses of hallucinogenic drugs can produce significant alterations of self-experience, described as the dissolution of the sense of self and the loss of boundaries between self and world. This article discusses the relevance of this phenomenon, known as "drug-induced ego dissolution (DIED)", for cognitive neuroscience, psychology and philosophy of mind. Data from self-report questionnaires suggest that three neuropharmacological classes of drugs can induce ego dissolution: classical psychedelics, dissociative anesthetics and agonists of the kappa opioid receptor (KOR). While these substances act on different neurotransmitter receptors, they all produce strong subjective effects that can be compared to the symptoms of acute psychosis, including ego dissolution. It has been suggested that neuroimaging of DIED can indirectly shed light on the neural correlates of the self. While this line of inquiry is promising, its results must be interpreted with caution. First, neural correlates of ego dissolution might reveal the necessary neurophysiological conditions for the maintenance of the sense of self, but it is more doubtful that this method can reveal its minimally sufficient conditions. Second, it is necessary to define the relevant notion of self at play in the phenomenon of DIED. This article suggests that DIED consists in the disruption of subpersonal processes underlying the "minimal" or "embodied" self, i.e., the basic experience of being a self rooted in multimodal integration of self-related stimuli. This hypothesis is consistent with Bayesian models of phenomenal selfhood, according to which the subjective structure of conscious experience ultimately results from the optimization of predictions in perception and action. Finally, it is argued that DIED is also of particular interest for philosophy of mind. On the one hand, it challenges theories according to which consciousness always involves self-awareness. On the other hand, it suggests that ordinary conscious experience might involve a minimal kind of self-awareness rooted in multisensory processing, which is what appears to fade away during DIED.Copyright © 2017 Milliere.

N2  - The natural products are the chemical constituents that are generated from the living organism. The natural products are isolated from the plants, animals, and microorganisms which are used in drug design and drug discovery. Natural product is then modified by chemical synthesis as either total or semi-synthetic way. The natural products show various pharmacological activity which can be used for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Natural products could be regarded as a source of quantifiable and chemically pure known products and also natural products can be utilized as complex mixtures subjected to chemical variability. The present review article adds up the prodrugs from natural products as well as prodrugs developed from the natural products.Copyright © 2017, Bangladesh Pharmacological Society.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - This "Designer Drugs 2.0" issue of Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics focuses on novel psychoactive substances, primarily cannabinoids and cathinones, and the repurposing of established psychoactive compounds (e.g., modafinil, psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) that simultaneously offer new pharmacotherapies and pose serious health problems. Novel psychoactive substances were initially used as potent tools to investigate endogenous neurotransmitter systems; for example, synthetic cannabinoids have much higher potency than DELTA9-tetrahydrocannabinol at the cannabinoid receptors. However, they are now being used illicitly as well as being tested for their efficacy in numerous clinical indications. Likewise, previously established psychoactive drugs are being repurposed as treatments for a wide variety of indications where currently approved medications are ineffective. This set of papers examines the arising problems associated with designer drugs (e.g., adverse events, psychosis, rapid new synthesis, abuse liability testing, internet sales, scheduling) as well as the potential therapeutic promises in areas as diverse as cognition enhancement, exercise-mimetics, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and posttraumatic stress disorder.Copyright © 2016 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics

N2  - Mental illness and substance use are overrepresented within urban homeless populations. This paper compared substance use patterns between homeless individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum (SS) and bipolar disorders (BD) using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. From a sample of 497 subjects drawn from Vancouver, Canada who participated in the At Home/ Chez Soi study, 146 and 94 homeless individuals were identified as BD and SS, respectively. In the previous 12months, a greater proportion of BDhomeless reported greater use of cocaine (chi2=20.0, p = 0.000), amphetamines (chi2 = 13,8, p = 0.000), opiates (chi2 = 24.6, p = 0.000), hallucinogens (chi2 = 11.7, p = 0.000), cannabinoids (chi2 = 5.05, p = 0.034), and tranquilizers (chi2 = 7.95, p = 0.004) compared to SS. Cocaine and opiates were significantly associated with BD homeless (chi2 = 39.06, df = 2, p < 0.000). The present study illustrates the relationship between substance use and BD in a vulnerable urban population of homeless, affected by adverse psychosocial factors and severe psychiatric conditions.

N2  - Psychedelics are psychoactive substances that powerfully alter perception, mood, and cognitive processes. Despite the published adverse reactions, they are now considered physiologically safe and do not produce dependence or addiction. Known and used for millennia, their human use predates written history, and they were employed by early cultures in a variety of sociocultural and ritual contexts. Although there has been a western interest for over half a century in the therapeutic use of classic hallucinogens to treat substance use disorders and other selected psychiatric disorders, medical research with these drugs was halted in the early 1970s, leaving many questions unanswered. In the past two decades, after extensive research about the possible harmful effects of those substances, clinical research on the potential therapeutic uses of classic hallucinogens and associated substances has resumed, focusing mainly on conditions for which current recommended treatment have low efficacy or none. To date, trials were conducted with LSD and psilocybin for the treatment of fear and anxiety in people suffering from terminal illnesses, various types of classic psychedelics for substance abuse, MDMA for resistant PTSD, ketamine for resistant unipolar depressive disorder, and several substances for obsessive-compulsive disorder and cluster headaches, with results that appear very promising. Nevertheless, further research is needed to explore the therapeutic application for these conditions and provide evidence for their efficacy. Indeed, such research is underway in several countries including Switzerland. This review aims to give an overview of the current research and theories underlying the putative therapeutic mechanisms of action, including psychological and pharmacological aspects.

N2  - Ayahuasca is a hallucinogen brew traditionally used for ritual and therapeutic purposes in Northwestern Amazon. It is rich in the tryptamine hallucinogens dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which acts as a serotonin 5-HT2A agonist. This mechanism of action is similar to other compounds such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin. The controlled use of LSD and psilocybin in experimental settings is associated with a low incidence of psychotic episodes, and population studies corroborate these findings. Both the controlled use of DMT in experimental settings and the use of ayahuasca in experimental and ritual settings are not usually associated with psychotic episodes, but little is known regarding ayahuasca or DMT use outside these controlled contexts. Thus, we performed a systematic review of the published case reports describing psychotic episodes associated with ayahuasca and DMT intake. We found three case series and two case reports describing psychotic episodes associated with ayahuasca intake, and three case reports describing psychotic episodes associated with DMT. Several reports describe subjects with a personal and possibly a family history of psychosis (including schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorders, psychotic mania, psychotic depression), nonpsychotic mania, or concomitant use of other drugs. However, some cases also described psychotic episodes in subjects without these previous characteristics. Overall, the incidence of such episodes appears to be rare in both the ritual and the recreational/noncontrolled settings. Performance of a psychiatric screening before administration of these drugs, and other hallucinogens, in controlled settings seems to significantly reduce the possibility of adverse reactions with psychotic symptomatology. Individuals with a personal or family history of any psychotic illness or nonpsychotic mania should avoid hallucinogen intake.Copyright © 2017, © The Author(s), 2017.

N2  - Objectives Cluster headache (CH) is a rare disease (1 to 3/1000), predominant in men (sex ratio: four men/one woman) and characterized by frequent very painful paroxystic attacks occurring sometimes eight times by day. CH is a disease without lesion and impairs the quality of life of patients. Attacks occur only on the same hemiface and can last from 15 minutes to 3 hours. The pain is particularly severe and a frequent and extreme psychiatric symptomatology is observed during the attacks. Treatments are rare and not always efficient: sumatriptan, oxygen, LSD, psilocybin. In this paper, we try to answer to the question: "What does that make you to have a cluster headache attack?" using elicitation interview developed by Vermersch. Patients and methods Ten patients have been interviewed using elicitation interview (EI) (40-50 min for one interview). All these patients (seven men's and three women's) T suffer from chronic or episodic CH, with a mean age of 43 years. The patients come from the Lariboisiere hospital (Paris), and more precisely from the center of headache urgency. EI allows describing the pre-reflexive consciousness contents. The method is described in Balzani et al., and in Petitmengin et al. (see bibliography). Data analyses were performed using Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Results From the EI, we have distinguished three phenomenological axes, following Heidegger's philosophy: (1) An alteration of being-to-the-world with a strong unbearable feeling of imprisonment, and physical restriction. At the same time the patients present a stereotypical and automatic behavior with few motor schemes and escaping strategies. When pain arises, they want to leave and to go very far. Aggressive behaviors frequently occur. Sometimes, the patients are not able to perform the sumatripan injection, due to a motor inhibition. Some patients try to do autohypnosis or other methods to resist to the pain. (2) An alteration of being-to-the self, going from the corporal distortion to the body dissolution. At the onset of symptoms, the patient does the experience of physical deformation, particularly of the face, with strong vegetative symptoms. The patient is not able to control corporeal manifestations: tears, mad thinks, incoherent projects in order to stop the crisis. Some patients want to remove the part of their body where the pain is the most intense (eye, for example). There is a losing of the body limits and a loss of the time orientation. In many cases, the pain is unbearable and patients want to commit suicide. At the extreme, the sensation of self seems destroyed, and some patients evoke an experience similar than Near Death Experiences, or describe an experience of swaying in emptiness or imminent death. (3) An alteration of being-to-the-other, going from the imperative solitude to the acceptance for a presence without words. Solitude is the most experience for the patients. They cannot accept anybody. Another person is unbearable, because asking questions about the crisis. In the same time, the patient is scared of this solitude since he is not able to speak about his painful experience. In summary, the structure of the self is altered, and thinking is completely disturbed. The experience of time and space is modified and a pragmatism is a consequence of this intense pain. During the crisis, pain is central and the patient lives a kind of dissolution, near death: a self-dismantling. Conclusion The EI have allowed us to describe precisely the painful experience of subjects with a cluster headache. This experience is very rich and very intense. EI, as a phenomenological method, is a very useful method to describe more precisely the symptomatology of a disease, because it pays attention to the effective experience of the pathological flesh, as compared to the pathological body.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS

N2  - Background: The States of Consciousness Questionnaire (SOCQ) was developed to assess the occurrence features of the change in consciousness induced by psilocybin, and includes the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), developed to assess the ocurrence of mystical experiences in altered states of consciousness. Objective: To translate the SOCQ to Brazilian Portuguese and validate the 30-item MEQ. Methods: The SOCQ was translated to Brazilian Portuguese and backtranslated into English. The two English versions were compared and differences corrected, resulting in a Brazilian translation. Using an internet-survey, 1504 Portuguese-speaking subjects answered the translated version of the SOCQ. The 4-factor version of MEQ30 was analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis and reliability analysis. Results: A Brazilian Portuguese version of the SOCQ was made available. Goodness-of-fit indexes indicated that data met the factorial structure proposed for the English MEQ30. Factors presented excellent to acceptable reliability according to Cronbach's alpha: mystical (0.95); positive mood (0.71); transcendence of time/space (0.83); and ineffability (0.81). Discussion: The Brazilian Portuguese version of the MEQ30 is validated and it fits in the factorial structure performed on the original English version. The SOCQ is also available to the Brazilian Portuguese speaking population, allowing studies in different languages to be conducted and compared systematically.Copyright © 2017, Lemos Editorial e Graficos Ltda.

N2  - Introduction:Panaeolina foenisecii is one of the most common and widely distributed lawn mushrooms in Europe and North America, and frequently involved in accidental mushroom ingestion, mainly in children. Nevertheless, there is contradictory information regarding the toxicity profile of P. foenisecii in the literature. Objective of the study was to assess clinical effects with particular attention on psychoactive properties of P. foenisecii in case of accidental oral exposure. Methods: This observational case series is based on prospectively collected data on mushroom poisoning using a structured data collection form, and it was performed in seven poisons centres in Germany and Switzerland. Inclusion criteria were accidental ingestion of at least one cap of P. foenisecii identified by a mycologist, and a follow up of at least 4 hours. Results: Nineteen cases met all inclusion criteria, and only children were involved with a mean age of 3 years. They ingested 1-2 mushrooms in 14 cases and 3-5 mushrooms in five cases. Three patients received a single dose of activated charcoal. Sixteen out of 19 cases did not develop any symptoms, 2/19 complained of minor abdominal discomfort. One child was temporarily mildly hyperactive, and this was the only patient observed in a hospital for 12 hours. None of the children showed signs of hallucinations. Conclusions: This multicentre study demonstrates that the typically small amounts of P. foenisecii ingested by children probably do not lead to clinically significant symptoms.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

T1  - Novel pharmacological treatment strategies for posttraumatic stress disorder

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Introduction: A wide range of medications have been studied for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a number are registered for this indication. Nevertheless, current pharmacotherapies are only partially effective in some patients, and are minimally effective in others. Thus novel treatment avenues need to be explored. Areas covered: In considering novel pharmacological agents for the treatment of PTSD, this paper takes a translational approach. We outline how advances in our understanding of the underlying neurobiology of PTSD may inform the identification of potential new treatment targets, including glutamatergic, noradrenergic and opioid pathways. Expert commentary: Continued investigation of the neural substrates and signalling pathways involved in responses to trauma may inform the development of novel treatment targets for future drug development for PTSD. However, the translation of preclinical findings to clinical practice is likely to be complex and gradual.Copyright © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

T1  - Role of psilocybin in the treatment of depression
A1  - Mahapatra A.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Psilocybin is a naturally occurring alkaloid, pharmacologically similar to the classic hallucinogen lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Although primarily used as a recreational drug or an entheogen in particular cultural settings, recent population based studies have shown that it does not lead to serious physical or mental health problems or dependent use. In view of recent work demonstrating psilocybin's potential to increase subjective sense of wellbeing and because of its novel mechanism of 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonism, it is being explored for possible therapeutic utility in mood and anxiety disorders.Copyright © 2016, © The Author(s), 2016.

Yet, due to their legal status, there has been limited scientific research into the therapeutic potential of these compounds for psychiatric disorders. In the absence of other effective treatments however, researchers have begun again to systematically investigate such compounds and there is now evidence pointing to the use of psychedelic drugs in the treatment of addiction. In this review we focus on human evidence for the effectiveness of preparations used by indigenous cultures in the Amazon (ayahausca) and Africa (ibogaine) and worldwide (psilocybin), and more recently synthetised drugs such as the serotonergic hallucinogen LSD and the dissociative anaesthetic ketamine. Potential mechanisms explored are anti-depressant effects, changes in neuroplasticity and existential psychological effects of these drugs.Copyright © 2016

N2  - Introduction Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a difficult-to-treat, neuropathic pain syndrome generally presenting within days of an amputation. The incidence is 50- 80% , with duration that is variable and may last years. Analgesic agents and mirror box therapy have shown some efficacy, but therapeutic options remain limited. We present a case of refractory PLP successfully treated with psilocybin combined mirror box therapy. There is no literature on the use of psilocybin for the treatment of pain. Results/Case report A 35 year old male suffered a complicated tibial fracture, with subsequent below the knee amputation. Aggressive treatment of his perioperative pain included opioids, pregabalin, nortriptyline, ketamine, and peripheral nerve block catheters. He denied PLP while block catheters were in place, but developed moderate PLP after their removal. Four weeks post-operatively, his neuropathic stump pain and PLP increased and he developed severe paroxysms of phantom ankle pain. He stopped using opioids as they provided little relief but continued taking pregabalin 200mg TID with only modest pain reduction. Mirror box therapy produced modest but brief pain relief. He was seen in follow-up and reported recent use of psilocybin containing mushrooms, which completely eliminated both the phantom pain and stump pain for 2-3 hours but with sensory disturbances and hallucinations. He subsequently tried low dose psilocybin which did not induce hallucinations and significantly reduced the pain. He then began a regimen of combining daily low dose psilocybin with mirror box therapy sessions. Over the course of 2-3 weeks he noted 30-60% improvement in his PLP and near complete resolution of the paroxysmal phantom ankle pain. The effect of mirror box therapy was reportedly much more vivid in combination with psilocybin. At 9 weeks post-operatively, he had reduced use of the psilocybin to several times per week and was tolerating use of a prosthetic limb. Patient consent for submission of the case report for publication and presentation has been obtained. Discussion PLP is thought to involve peripheral and central neuroplastic changes. Centrally, cortical reorganization has been shown to be positively correlated with the presence of PLP. Psilocybin has been shown to be efficacious in treatment of depression, anxiety, and OCD , but there is no literature on its use for pain. Studies have shown its role in enhancing neuroplasticity and modulating prefrontal cortex activity via interactions with serotonin and glutamate systems . Mirror box therapy is a simple, non-invasive procedure to help patients visualize an amputated limb which has been shown to improve phantom limb pain . The benefits of mirror box therapy may be due to effects on cortical reorganization, in addition to more immediate modulation of pain by visual feedback . The use of psilocybin may enhance the reversal of cortical reorganization with mirror box therapy and thus reduce PLP. This combination of therapies may provide a novel treatment option for phantom limb pain. Given the dramatic reduction in severity and duration of PLP in this case, further investigation into the use of psilocybin as an analgesic agent may be warranted.

N2  - Objective: Testimonials dating back to the 1960s have described the microdosing of LSD to have nootropic properties such as cognitive enhancement, physical boost, increased creativity and mindfulness. Microdosing refers to ingesting subperceptual amounts of psychedelic drugs. Research Design and Methods: This paper catalogued 600 reports from microdosing users from Reddit and Erowid. The drugs examined were Tryptamines (5- methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, Psilocybin),Ergolines, Phenethylamines (Mescaline, The 2C family, NBOMe derivative, 2,5-dimethoxy, 4-substituted amphetamines), Cannabinoids and Empathogens (Substituted methylenedioxy- phenthylamines). Self-reports of microdosing with prescribed nootropic drugs such as, psychostimulants (methylphenidate and amphetamine) and wakefulness-promoting agents (modafinil) were also collected. The data is composed of the methodology of the microdosing, which includes dosage, form of administration, tolerance and tolerance duration. Furthermore, the physiological and cognitive differs have been achieved, this encompasses sleep, side effects, appetite, motivation, concentration, memory, physical energy. Results: 56 % of the users choose Ergolines for microdosing, 32 % with Tryptamines, and 12 % with Phenetylamines, Empathogens and Psychostimulants. Users experienced a variety of effects such as emotional clarity, enhanced senses, increased concentration and stamina. However there were several reports of reduced appetite, excessive sweating, reduced sleep, and digestive and warped time perception.

T1  - Planckian information calculated from fMRI signals indicates that psilocybin increases neurodynamic organizations in human brains

N2  - Planckian information (IP) [1] is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio between the area under the curve (AUC) of a long-tailed histogram fitting the Planckian distribution equation (PDE) [1, 2] and the AUC of the conjugate Gaussian-like equation. The first term in PDE, y=(A/(x + B)5)/(eC/(x + B) -1), is related to the number of standing waves formed in the system and the second term to the average energy of the standing waves [1, 2]. PDE has been found to fit many long-tailed histograms [1, 2] including the fMRI signals reported by Carhart-Harris et al. [3] whose subjects were 15 healthy volunteers before and after psilocybin infusion. Four brain regions exhibited significant changes in fMRI signals characterized by increases in the deviations of the local signals from their mean. When the distances of the signals of individual voxels from the group-mean fMRI signal are grouped and their frequencies counted, long-tailed histograms were obtained which fitted PDE. The numerical values IP increased from 1.04 bits to 1.31 bits. One interpretation of this observation is that the psilocybin infusion increased the neurodynamic organizations in the human brain. This interpretation differs from the one offered by Carhart- Harris et al., and possible reasons for this discrepancy will be presented.

N2  - Aims: A broad range of phenomenological experiences have been reported after psilocybin ingestion. Both mystical-type and psychologically challenging experiences have been characterized. This report summarizes several data sets to characterize the incidence of other anomalous experiences associated with psilocybin when ingested in both research and non-research settings. Methods: Three data sets were examined: (1) An internet-based survey of mystical-type experiences (ME; N= 1602) after ingesting psilocybin mushrooms; (2) an internet survey of psychologically difficult/challenging experience (CE; N= 1993) after ingesting psilocybin mushrooms; and (3) combined data from 3 laboratory studies conducted in healthy volunteers (LS; n = 110-126) who received a high dose of psilocybin (30 mg/70 kg). The percentage of respondents who endorsed specific anomalous experiences as "moderate," "strong," or "extreme" were calculated for each of the three data sets. Results: Mean (range) of percentage endorsement of the anomalous experiences across the 3 data sets were: loss of usual sense of time 88% (86-90%); visions of abstract geometric patterns 76% (71-79%); visions of art objects such as mosaics, statues, or jewellery 41% (33-48%); convincing feelings of obtaining information in an extrasensory manner 36% (26-45%); profound experience of own death 29% (22-34%); visions of blissful or compassionate deities 25% (13-38%); reliving situations and events form childhood 20% (17-22%); contact with people who have died 17% (10-27%); visions of demons, devils, or wrathful deities 16% (10-22%); sense of becoming a specific animal 15% (10-21%); reliving part of another life prior to birth (previous incarnation) 13% (10-16%); and reliving experiences as an infant during biological birth 11% (10-12%). Conclusions: After ingesting psilocybin in both research and non-research settings, individuals endorse a wide range of phenomena including various anomalous and parapsychological experiences, the determinants of which are unknown.

N2  - Aims: Descriptions of meditation experiences can bear striking similarity to descriptions of some experiences with classic (serotonergic) hallucinogens. Neuroimaging studies reveal striking overlap in the effects of psilocybin and the effects of meditation on functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN). This ongoing study explored the effects of psilocybin on subjective experience and DMN connectivity in long-term meditators. Methods: 16 meditators (mean lifetime meditation = 4206 h) received either a placebo (n = 8) or a high dose psilocybin (n = 8) capsule before a laboratory session. Retrospective self-report measures of subjective experience and resting-state fMRI data were collected the day after the session. Seed-based functional connectivity analyses were applied to fMRI data. Self-report measures and functional connectivity of the DMN were compared between placebo and psilocybin groups. Results: Participants who received psilocybin attributed significantly greater meaning, spiritual significance, psychological challenge, and psychological insight to their session experiences than those who received placebo. 75% of participants in the psilocybin group rated the experience to be in the top 10 most meaningful experiences of their life. Participants who received psilocybin also showed lower functional connectivity between hippocampal and posterior DMN regions and greater functional connectivity among DMN regions than those who received placebo. Conclusions: Participants attributed substantial meaning to their high-dose psilocybin experience, andshowedchanges in brain function the day after a high dose of psilocybin. Further research should explore the relationship of these enduring changes in brain function to abuse liability and therapeutic outcomes with psilocybin.

N2  - Aims: To examine instances in which psychedelic use may have led to reduced drug use. Methods: An anonymous online survey assessed demographics, drug use history, addiction/withdrawal severity, and data on participants' psychedelic-occasioned experience and perceived effects on substance use. Results: Participants (N= 301) were predominantly White (87%), males (67%), in the US (60%), mean age 32 yrs. Participants reported reductions in alcohol (53% of participants), cannabis (19%), opioid (17%), and stimulant (11%) use after taking a psychedelic. 61% reported continuous substance use reduction lasting >=1 yr. since their reference psychedelic experience. Psilocybin (37%) and LSD (34%) were most commonly associated with reduced substance use. 90% of participants met DSM 5 criteria for a substance use disorder (SUD) before their reference psychedelic experience, with 64% having a severe SUD. Afterward, 19% met criteria for a SUD, with 4% meeting severe SUD criteria. 159 reported reduced alcohol use from a mode of 5-6 drinks on >=4 days/week to a mode of 1-2 drinks/month, with 21% (n = 34) reporting total alcohol abstinence since their psychedelic use. 57 reported reduced cannabis use from a mode of 1-2 uses on >=4 days/week to a mode of 1-2 uses/month, with 21% (n = 12) reporting total cannabis abstinence since their psychedelic use. 51 reported opioid reduction from a mode of 1-2 uses on >=4 days/week to a mode of total opioid abstinence (n = 33; 65%) since their psychedelic use. 34 reported stimulant reduction from a mode of 1-4 uses on >=4 days/week to a mode of total stimulant abstinence (n = 20; 59%) since their psychedelic use. Conclusions: Psychedelic use may sometimes lead to persisting reductions in alcohol and drug use, consistent with prior research suggesting efficacy of psychedelic-facilitated addiction treatment. Further controlled research in this area is indicated.

N2  - Aims: The FDA's Botanical Drug Development (2015) describes the pathway for a drug of botanical origins to be tested for safety and efficacy so that itmaybecome a marketed drug product. As with any drug under development, botanical drugs must comply with all regulations of the FD&CA. Thus,whena botanical drug has CNS activity, it will need to undergo an abuse potential assessment by the Controlled Substance Staff at FDA, as described in the FDA's Assessment of the Abuse Potential of Drugs (2010). A CSS evaluation also occurs when the DEA is considering whether to place a newly emerging street drug of botanical origins under the control of the Controlled Substances Act. Currently, only five plants or their constituent parts are scheduled under the CSA: Cannabis spp. (marijuana, Sch. I hallucinogen), Tabernanthe iboga (ibogaine, Sch. I hallucinogen), Lophophora williamsii (peyote cactus; Sch. I hallucinogen); Opium poppy and poppy straw (from Papaver somniferum, Sch. II opiate), and Coca leaves (only this plant part from Erythroxylum coca, Sch. II stimulant). In contrast, scheduled substances such as psilocybin and psilocyn (Sch. I hallucinogen), cocaine (Sch. II stimulant), cathinone (Sch. I stimulant), and cathine (Sch. IV stimulant) are derived from botanical sources that are not themselves scheduled. This presentation will detail the challenges involved in evaluating botanicals for abuse potential. These include whether it is necessary to evaluate the entire plant structure, how chemicals extracted from a plant may be tested in animal abuse-related studies, how to select an appropriate positive control, how to manage the presence of other constituents of the botanical substance, and how to test the botanical drug in a human abuse potential study. Conclusions: A botanical drug with CNS activity must undergo an abuse potential assessment to fully evaluate its safety. Although there are challenges for these novel drug products, an appropriate assessment of these drugs is possible using the principles of regulatory science.

N2  - Background: Plant and fungi represent a heterogeneous group of agents, with a wide range of clinical effects. Little has been published regarding the epidemiology or management of plant and fungi ingestions. Research question: To describe the prevalence of plant and fungi ingestions, including prevalence for specific agents, and review adverse outcomes and specific management strategies associated with specific agents. Methods: The Toxicology Investigators Consortium (ToxIC) Registry records all clinical consults by an international network of medical toxicologists in a standardized fashion. ToxIC was queried for all cases of exposures categorized as '"Plant and Fungi." These exposures were categorized using descriptive statistics. Results: About 427 Plant and Fungi exposures were reported to ToxIC between 2010 and 2016. Of these exposures, 178 (41.7%) were classified as mold exposure, 176 of which occurred in an outpatient clinic. Of the remaining 249 exposures, there were 64 unique agents reported. Intentional ingestions numbered 146 (58.6%), unintentional ingestions numbered 69 (27.7%), while in 26 the intent was unknown (10.4%). The five most common named exposures were psilocybin mushrooms (20, 8.0%), Datura species (16, 6.4%), Mitragyna speciosa or '"kratom" (15, 6.0%), cyclopeptide-containing mushrooms (14, 5.6%), and Nerium oleander (11, 4.4%). There were 78 unknown/other mushroom exposures (31.3%). Other notable exposures include four castor bean exposures, three strychnine exposures, and three solanine exposures. Two deaths were reported, in a case of kratom exposure and in a case of cyclopeptide mushroom exposure. Toxicological antidotes were given in 61 cases (24.5%); the most common antidotes used were N-acetylcysteine (26), physostigmine (10), fab for digoxin (8), sodium bicarb (6), atropine (5), and naloxone (5). Seven of 16 Datura sp. poisonings received physostigmine, seven of 11 Nerium oleander poisonings received fab for digoxin, and 20 of 109 mushroom poisonings received N-acetylcysteine. Vasopressors were used in two patients, activated charcoal was given to 15 patients, and nine patients were intubated. Discussion: Plant and fungi exposures reported to ToxIC between 2010 and 2016 were highly heterogeneous. Management strategies and clinical outcomes were variable given the disparate types of ingestions. Conclusions: In cases recorded in the ToxIC registry, a wide variety of plant and fungi ingestions were reported although fatal outcomes were rare. ToxIC may be a viable tool for studying select rare plant and fungi exposures, including mushrooms, Datura, and Kratom.

T1  - Psilocybin mushroom exposures reported to poison control centers: An NPDS study

N2  - Background: Psilocybin is a tryptamine alkaloid found in some hallucinogenic mushrooms which can cause intense psychedelic experiences. Psilocybin is being reexamined as a potential therapeutic agent for various conditions. The risk and the range of toxicity from intentional and unintentional psilocybin exposures are unknown. One report in the literature from 1962 describes a fatal case of pediatric convulsions and cerebral edema. Other reports describe myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, acute, and persistent psychosis or hallucinations, as well as traumatic injuries. Few studies have examined modern use and effects on humans in a large population. National Poison Data System (NPDS) data were analyzed to assess the effects reported with psilocybin exposures to characterize potentially serious adverse outcomes. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of psilocybin exposures as a single agent or in conjunction with cannabis from 1/1/2000 to 12/31/2015 reported to United States poison centers using the NPDS database. Cases were excluded if exposure to other agents was reported including synthetic and unconventional cannabis use. A separate NPDS request of all fatality reports with psilocybin as a substance was assessed by an independent review by both authors to determine the role of psilocybin in contributing to the cause of death. Cases were excluded (from both sets when applicable) if there was no clear evidence of psilocybin exposure or if significant concurrent exposures were reported. Data trends were examined to determine monthly and yearly exposures with normalization for the varying number of NPDS yearly human exposures. In cases with known outcome, we compared the number of pediatric (<13 years) unintentional exposures versus adult (>19 years) intentional exposures for major outcome versus the grouped outcome of no effect, minor, or moderate. We determined the number of cases with reports of seizures (all types) in the adult and pediatric populations. Groups were compared using Fisher's exact test to assess for significance (p<.05). Results: There were 9015 exposures that met inclusion criteria; all deaths were excluded by unanimous agreement. From 2000 to 2004, psilocybin-containing mushroom exposures trended upward but have declined steadily since. Reported exposures peaked in June and October. The average pediatric exposure age was 3.4 years of age, and the average adult age was 26.4 years. Major outcomes were significantly more likely to occur (p=.005) in adults with intentional exposure (54/2062) than with unintentional pediatric exposures (1/321). There were no seizures reported among all 562 pediatric exposures compared with 1.4% (51/3680) of all adult exposures (p=.002). Conclusions: There appears to be seasonality associated with psilocybin exposures. Adult intentional exposures were more likely to experience major outcomes than pediatric unintentional exposures. Seizures were rarely reported in the adult population. Potential explanations for these clinical findings include unreported coingestants, intrinsic lower toxicity in pediatric patients, or lower amount of psilocybin exposure in unintentional ingestions. There were no deaths that could be attributed to psilocybin exposure alone. Our results suggest psilocybin has less toxicity than previously suggested in isolated case reports.

T1  - Presence of new psychoactive substances as likely adjuvants formulated in conjunction with LSD: A case report of three patients

N2  - Background: New psychoactive substances (NPS) are an emerging and serious threat to public health. Clandestine laboratories are constantly producing new chemicals and combinations of substances with intent to augment the drug user's experience. We report three cases of dramatic psychostimulant toxicity involving a combination of NPS and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Cases: Three 20-year-old college students presented to the emergency department with altered mental status after using blotter paper sold to them as '"acid" before a football game. They all used the same product. All three patients had mydriasis, delirium, psychosis with visual and auditory hallucinations, and combative behavior requiring chemical sedation and physical restraint. One patient sustained minor head trauma after repeatedly hitting her head on a wall but had a normal CT brain. Initial vital signs in all patients were remarkable for tachycardia and hypertension with normal temperature and oxygen saturation. Laboratory evaluations for all three patients showed normal values on CBC, CPK, and chemistry panels; ECGs showed normal intervals. Urine drug screens were negative for amfetamines and cocaine in all patients; one patient was positive for THC. All three patients were admitted and improved after 24 h of observation with no sequela. Initial serum samples obtained on ED presentation were analyzed using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry to evaluate the presence of NPS. Serum analysis for all three patients confirmed the presence of LSD, N-propyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamfetamine (3,4-MDPA), 3-methoxy-2-keto-1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-pyrrolidine (3-MeO-2-keto-PCPy), and 4-Acetyloxy-N,Ndiallyltryptamine (4-AcO-DALT). Discussion: 3,4-MDPA is a psychoactive substituted phenethylamine and thought to be an enhancer for hallucinogenic drugs. 3-MeO-2-keto-PCPy is a novel dissociative drug and analog of phencylidine. 4-AcO-DALT is a novel tryptamine compound that is chemically similar to psilocybin. All three of these substances are believed to act as enhancers/adjuvants for hallucinogenic drugs. In our cases, patients exhibited sympathomimetic and psychostimulant effects with self-injurious behavior. The duration of effects observed in our patients was about 24 h and all improved with no sequela. Conclusions: Our cases show that 3,4-MDPA, 3-Meo-2-keto-PCPy, and 4-AcO-DALT can be present in combination with hallucinogenic drugs like LSD, and produce dramatic psychostimulant effects on users. Toxicologists should anticipate the presence of NPS when evaluating patients with severe or unusual toxidromes.

N2  - Several findings suggest that 5HT2A receptors (5HT2AR) may be involved in the molecular mechanisms responsible for psychotic symptoms. Hallucinogenic drugs acting as 5HT2AR agonists, such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and dimethoxyiodoamphetamine (DOI) produce psychosis-like symptoms in healthy subjects. On the other hand, cannabis intoxication induces in healthy subjects cognitive alterations similar to those seen in schizophrenia and worsens the symptoms in schizophrenic patients. These data may suggest a link between cannabis and psychosis. Our aim was to investigate the status and functionality of 5HT2AR in brain cortex of adolescent mice chronically treated with DELTA9-THC. Mice were treated during adolescent period with DELTA9-THC (10 mg/kg daily, 30 days, i.p.) or vehicle. Prepulse inhibition test (PPI) was performed in both groups at basal conditions and after acute DOI injection (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Displacement curves of specific [3H]ketanserin binding (2 nM) by DOI (10-12 to 10-3 M) were also carried out in brain cortex membranes. Moreover, specific stimulation of different Galpha proteins by DOI (10-5 M) following a [35S]GTPcS binding assay combined with immunoprecipitation was determined. Chronic DELTA9-THC significantly potentiated (p < 0.05) the DOI-induced reduction in the PPI. Additionally, although no changes were found in the density of 5HT2AR, a significant increase (p < 0.01) in the affinity of G-protein pre-coupled population of 5HT2AR was observed in brain cortex of DELTA9-THC-treated mice. Moreover, a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the 5HT2AR-mediated stimulation of Gai1, Galphai3, Galphao and Galphaz protein subtypes but not of Gas or Gaq/11 subunits was found in DELTA9-THC-treated mice compared to controls. Our results show that, in mice brain cortex, chronic exposure to D9- THC during adolescence enhances the 5HT2AR ability to activate specific pathways of inhibitory Galpha protein subtypes. This finding suggests that chronic cannabis exposure induces a pro-hallucinogenic 5HT2AR conformation that may facilitate the development of psychosis.

N2  - Only recently has the full therapeutic value of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HT)] receptor activation begun to be explored. Currently there are two 5-HT2A receptor agonists in human clinical trials for the treatment of depression and obesity. An exciting new therapeutic avenue in which 5-HT2A agonists might be employed is the modulation of inflammation in allergic airways disease. Our lab has previously used an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma model to demonstrate that administration of (R)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine [(R)-DOI] prior to allergen challenge prevents many of the symptoms of allergic asthma. Here we have utilized a modified protocol to test the effectiveness of (R)-DOI in treating persistent allergic asthma. We demonstrate that administration of (R)-DOI in a chronic model attenuates the elevated airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) typically observed in an asthmatic response. We also have probed for the expression of inflammatory markers in the lung and BALF. We concurrently are testing for the impact psilocybin and other tryptamines have on AHR in rodents using our OVA model. Overall our strategy is to develop 5-HT2A receptor agonism as a viable treatment modality against asthma and other inflammatory disorders.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - 4-phosphorloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (psilocybin) and methylenedioxymethamfetamine (MDMA), best known for their illegal use as psychedelic drugs, are showing promise as therapeutics in a resurgence of clinical research during the past 10 years. Psilocybin is being tested for alcoholism, smoking cessation, and in patients with advanced cancer with anxiety. MDMA is showing encouraging results as a treatment for refractory post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety in autistic adults, and anxiety associated with a life-threatening illness. Both drugs are studied as adjuncts or catalysts to psychotherapy, rather than as stand-alone drug treatments. This model of drug-assisted psychotherapy is a possible alternative to existing pharmacological and psychological treatments in psychiatry. Further research is needed to fully assess the potential of these compounds in the management of these common disorders that are difficult to treat with existing methods.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - The epistemic innocence of psychedelic states
A1  - Letheby C. 
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - One recent development in epistemology, the philosophical study of knowledge, is the notion of 'epistemic innocence' introduced by Bortolotti and colleagues. This concept expresses the idea that certain suboptimal cognitive processes may nonetheless have epistemic (knowledge-related) benefits. The idea that delusion or confabulation may have psychological benefits is familiar enough. What is novel and interesting is the idea that such conditions may also yield significant and otherwise unavailable epistemic benefits. I apply the notion of epistemic innocence to research on the transformative potential of psychedelic drugs. The popular epithet 'hallucinogen' exemplifies a view of these substances as fundamentally epistemically detrimental. I argue that the picture is more complicated and that some psychedelic states can be epistemically innocent. This conclusion is highly relevant to policy debates about psychedelic therapy. Moreover, analysing the case of psychedelics can shed further light on the concept of epistemic innocence itself.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Modulatory effect of the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone and the mixed non-hallucinogenic 5-HT1A/2A agonist ergotamine on psilocybin-induced psychedelic experience
A1  - Pokorny T.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - The mixed serotonin (5-HT) 1A/2A/2B/2C/6/7 receptor agonist psilocybin dose-dependently induces an altered state of consciousness (ASC) that is characterized by changes in sensory perception, mood, thought, and the sense of self. The psychological effects of psilocybin are primarily mediated by 5-HT2A receptor activation. However, accumulating evidence suggests that 5-HT1A or an interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors may contribute to the overall effects of psilocybin. Therefore, we used a double-blind, counterbalanced, within-subject design to investigate the modulatory effects of the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone (20 mg p.o.) and the non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2A/1A agonist ergotamine (3 mg p.o.) on psilocybin-induced (170 mug/kg p.o.) psychological effects in two groups (n=19, n=17) of healthy human subjects. Psychological effects were assessed using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) rating scale. Buspirone significantly reduced the 5D-ASC main scale score for Visionary Restructuralization (VR) (p<0.001), which was mostly driven by a reduction of the VR item cluster scores for elementary and complex visual hallucinations. Further, buspirone also reduced the main scale score for Oceanic Boundlessness (OB) including derealisation and depersonalisation phenomena at a trend level (p=0.062), whereas ergotamine did not show any effects on the psilocybin-induced 5D-ASC main scale scores. The present finding demonstrates that buspirone exerts inhibitory effects on psilocybin-induced effects, presumably via 5-HT1A receptor activation, an interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, or both. The data suggest that the modulation of 5-HT1A receptor activity may be a useful target in the treatment of visual hallucinations in different psychiatric and neurological diseases.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

T1  - The potential utility of some legal highs in CNS disorders
A1  - Davidson C.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Over the last decade there has been an explosion of new drugs of abuse, so called legal highs or novel psychoactive substances (NPS). Many of these abused drugs have unknown pharmacology, but their biological effects can be anticipated from their molecular structure and possibly also from online user reports. When considered with the findings that some prescription medications are increasingly abused and that some abused drugs have been tested clinically one could argue that there has been a blurring of the line between drugs of abuse and clinically used drugs. In this review we examine these legal highs/NPS and consider whether, based on their known or predicted pharmacology, some might have the potential to be clinically useful in CNS disorders.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Classic hallucinogens in the treatment of addictions
A1  - Bogenschutz M.P.
A1  - Johnson M.W. 
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Addictive disorders are very common and have devastating individual and social consequences. Currently available treatment is moderately effective at best. After many years of neglect, there is renewed interest in potential clinical uses for classic hallucinogens in the treatment of addictions and other behavioral health conditions. In this paper we provide a comprehensive review of both historical and recent clinical research on the use of classic hallucinogens in the treatment of addiction, selectively review other relevant research concerning hallucinogens, and suggest directions for future research. Clinical trial data are very limited except for the use of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism, where a meta-analysis of controlled trials has demonstrated a consistent and clinically significant beneficial effect of high-dose LSD. Recent pilot studies of psilocybin-assisted treatment of nicotine and alcohol dependence had strikingly positive outcomes, but controlled trials will be necessary to evaluate the efficacy of these treatments. Although plausible biological mechanisms have been proposed, currently the strongest evidence is for the role of mystical or other meaningful experiences as mediators of therapeutic effects. Classic hallucinogens have an excellent record of safety in the context of clinical research. Given our limited understanding of the clinically relevant effects of classic hallucinogens, there is a wealth of opportunities for research that could contribute important new knowledge and potentially lead to valuable new treatments for addiction.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc..

N2  - The incidence of fungal poisoning varies considerably globally and is related to local habits, economic factors and lifestyle. Mushroom poisoning is mostly an accidental result of a mix-up between edible and toxic fungi. However, intentional ingestion of psychotropic ('magic') mushrooms has become a problem. Among thousands of mushroom species worldwide, fewer than a hundred are severely toxic. Most fungal toxins cause mild or moderate poisoning, often only gastroenteritis; the ingestion of a few species of extremely poisonous fungi defines the medical dimension of the problem. The most dreaded poisonings are those caused by cytotoxic fungi, for example amatoxins in death cap (Amanita phalloides) and destroying angel (Amanita virosa); both cause severe gastroenteritis and liver damage. Orellanine, occurring in certain Cortinarius spp., can induce severe and persistent kidney damage. Dramatic, but rarely lethal, effects are caused by fungi containing neurotoxins such as muscarine (Clitocybe and Inocybe spp.), psilocybin (Psilocybe and Panaeolus spp. - 'magic' mushrooms), isoxazoles (fly agaric, panther cap) and gyromitrin (false morels). Treatment is focused on general symptomatic and supportive care, although antidotes exist for fungi containing muscarine (atropine), gyromitrin (pyridoxine) and amatoxins (silibinin [silibinin is approved e.g. in Sweden and Germany (Legalon SIL D)], penicillin); the benefit of the latter has not yet been fully established.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Serotonergic hallucinogens produce alterations of perceptions, mood, and cognition, and have anxiolytic, antidepressant, and antiaddictive properties. These drugs act as agonists of frontocortical 5-HT2A receptors, but the neural basis of their effects are not well understood. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of neuroimaging studies analyzing the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens in man. Studies published in the PubMed, Lilacs, and SciELO databases until 12 April 2016 were included using the following keywords: "ayahuasca", "DMT", "psilocybin", "LSD", "mescaline" crossed one by one with the terms "mri", "fmri", "pet", "spect", "imaging" and "neuroimaging". Of 279 studies identified, 25 were included. Acute effects included excitation of frontolateral/frontomedial cortex, medial temporal lobe, and occipital cortex, and inhibition of the default mode network. Long-term use was associated with thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex, thickening of the anterior cingulate cortex, and decreased neocortical 5-HT2A receptor binding. Despite the high methodological heterogeneity and the small sample sizes, the results suggest that hallucinogens increase introspection and positive mood by modulating brain activity in the fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital cortex.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Developing methods for improving creativity is of broad interest. Classic psychedelics may enhance creativity; however, the underlying mechanisms of action are unknown. This study was designed to assess whether a relationship exists between naturalistic classic psychedelic use and heightened creative problem-solving ability and if so, whether this is mediated by lifetime mystical experience. Participants (N = 68) completed a survey battery assessing lifetime mystical experience and circumstances surrounding the most memorable experience. They were then administered a functional fixedness task in which faster completion times indicate greater creative problem-solving ability. Participants reporting classic psychedelic use concurrent with mystical experience (n = 11) exhibited significantly faster times on the functional fixedness task (Cohen's d = -.87; large effect) and significantly greater lifetime mystical experience (Cohen's d =.93; large effect) than participants not reporting classic psychedelic use concurrent with mystical experience. However, lifetime mystical experience was unrelated to completion times on the functional fixedness task (standardized beta = -.06), and was therefore not a significant mediator. Classic psychedelic use may increase creativity independent of its effects on mystical experience. Maximizing the likelihood of mystical experience may need not be a goal of psychedelic interventions designed to boost creativity.Copyright © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - The Health Officers Council of British Columbia has proposed post-prohibition regulatory models for currently illegal drugs based on public health principles, and this article continues this work by proposing a model for the regulation and management of psychedelics. This article outlines recent research on psychedelic substances and the key determinants of benefit and harm from their use. It then describes a public-health-based model for the regulation of psychedelics, which includes governance, supervision, set and setting controls, youth access, supply control, demand limitation, and evaluation.Copyright © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Background Psilocybin is a serotonin receptor agonist that occurs naturally in some mushroom species. Recent studies have assessed the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for various conditions, including end-of-life anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and smoking and alcohol dependence, with promising preliminary results. Here, we aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression. Methods In this open-label feasibility trial, 12 patients (six men, six women) with moderate-to-severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. There was no control group. Psychological support was provided before, during, and after each session. The primary outcome measure for feasibility was patient-reported intensity of psilocybin's effects. Patients were monitored for adverse reactions during the dosing sessions and subsequent clinic and remote follow-up. Depressive symptoms were assessed with standard assessments from 1 week to 3 months after treatment, with the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) serving as the primary efficacy outcome. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN14426797. Findings Psilocybin's acute psychedelic effects typically became detectable 30-60 min after dosing, peaked 2-3 h after dosing, and subsided to negligible levels at least 6 h after dosing. Mean self-rated intensity (on a 0-1 scale) was 0.51 (SD 0.36) for the low-dose session and 0.75 (SD 0.27) for the high-dose session. Psilocybin was well tolerated by all of the patients, and no serious or unexpected adverse events occurred. The adverse reactions we noted were transient anxiety during drug onset (all patients), transient confusion or thought disorder (nine patients), mild and transient nausea (four patients), and transient headache (four patients). Relative to baseline, depressive symptoms were markedly reduced 1 week (mean QIDS difference -11.8, 95% CI -9.15 to -14.35, p=0.002, Hedges' g=3.1) and 3 months (-9.2, 95% CI -5.69 to -12.71, p=0.003, Hedges' g=2) after high-dose treatment. Marked and sustained improvements in anxiety and anhedonia were also noted. Interpretation This study provides preliminary support for the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression and motivates further trials, with more rigorous designs, to better examine the therapeutic potential of this approach.

N2  - Psilocybin has recently attracted a great deal of attention as a clinical research and therapeutic tool. The aim of this paper is to bridge two major knowledge gaps regarding its behavioural pharmacology - sex differences and the underlying receptor mechanisms. We used psilocin (0.25, 1 and 4 mg/kg), an active metabolite of psilocybin, in two behavioural paradigms - the open-field test and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reaction. Sex differences were evaluated with respect to the phase of the female cycle. The contribution of serotonin receptors in the behavioural action was tested in male rats with selective serotonin receptor antagonists: 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (WAY100635 1 mg/kg), 5-HT2A receptor antagonist (MDL100907 0.5 mg/kg), 5-HT2B receptor antagonist (SB215505 1 mg/kg) and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist (SB242084 1 mg/kg). Psilocin induced dose-dependent inhibition of locomotion and suppression of normal behaviour in rats (behavioural serotonin syndrome, impaired PPI). The effects were more pronounced in male rats than in females. The inhibition of locomotion was normalized by 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B/C antagonists; however, PPI was not affected significantly by these antagonists. Our findings highlight an important issue of sex-specific reactions to psilocin and that apart from 5-HT2A-mediated effects 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C/B receptors also play an important role. These findings have implications for recent clinical trials.Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether executive functioning (EF) in early adolescence predicted alcohol use disorder (AUD) in late adolescence and whether adolescents with AUD differed in maturation of EF from controls without a diagnosis. Methods: We used the data from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), a cohort of 2230 Dutch adolescents. Working memory, inhibition, and attention were measured at ages 11 and 19. At age 19, lifetime DSM-IV diagnoses were determined, resulting in a control group (n = 1111) and two AUD groups, i.e., alcohol abusers (n = 381) and alcohol dependents (n = 51). Regression analyses assessed whether EF at age 11 predicted the transition to AUD in late adolescence and whether AUD affected maturation of EF from age 11 to 19. Results: EF in early adolescence did not predict AUD in late adolescence. A significant interaction effect emerged between gender and alcohol dependence for shift attention (beta = 0.12, SE=0.36), with girls showing smaller maturational rates. This effect remained significant after controlling for alcohol intake (ages 16 and 19) and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Discussion: Our results do not replicate the finding that EF in early adolescence is a significant predictor of AUD in late adolescence. Furthermore, for the majority of tasks, adolescents with AUD do not differ in EF maturation over the course of adolescence. Alcohol dependent girls however, show less maturation of shift attention. This is independent of the quantity of alcohol intake, which could suggest that non-normative maturation of EF is associated with the behavioural components of AUD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Modeling the flesh of god: Semantic hyperpriming and the Teonancatl cults of Mexico
A1  - Smith K.R. 
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - The ritualistic use of the ancient psychoactive sacrament teonanacatl, or "The Flesh of God," represents an integral aspect of pre-colonial Mesoamerican culture and continues, in various syncretic forms, to this day. Providing a brief history of various tribes of Mexico known to utilize Psilocibe species within a shamanic context, focusing primarily on the Mazatec people of Oaxaca, this paper attempts to utilize contemporary cognitive research of psilocybin to better understand and contextualize the ancient teonanacatl ceremony; specifically, research into psilocybin's induction of the hyperpriming state of cognition. Hyperpriming, or indirect semantic priming, is characterized by its expansive branched hierarchical associative structure within the semantic network and presents us with a valid and useful explanatory framework with which to interpret many of the reported psychological, linguistic, and perceptual effects underlying the traditional teonanacatl ceremony.Copyright © 2016, E-FLOW PDF NeuroQuantology.

T1  - A phenomenological examination of psilocybin and its positive and persisting aftereffects
A1  - Zamaria J.A. 
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - This study is an examination of the positive and persisting psychological and behavioral aftereffects in eight individuals who reported consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms. Mushrooms containing psilocybin have been used for healing and spiritual purposes for thousands of years, and the therapeutic applications of psilocybin were scientifically examined beginning in the mid-20th century. Research from this era suggested that psilocybin was indicated as an effective adjunct to psychotherapy for conditions such as depression, anxiety, chemical dependency, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Recent research at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine demonstrated that participants who consumed psilocybin reported having profoundly meaningful experiences, and that these participants experienced persisting and positive changes to their mood, attitude, and behavior at 1-month and 14-month follow up. However, there has not yet been ample research examining the mechanism of the connection between participants' experience with psilocybin and the existence of these positive and persisting aftereffects. This study employed a phenomenological approach, using an unstructured interview to gain an understanding of participants' description of this mechanism. Eight adults were interviewed who reported using psilocybin in the past. A within-case analysis and cross-case analysis were conducted on the data, producing 11 themes within three categories: Set (which included the themes of Preliminary Anxiety and Substantial Preparation); Experience of Psilocybin Effect (which included the themes of Profound Shift in Attention, Unity Consciousness, Increased Introspection, Positive Emotional State, and Transcendental Experience); and Persisting Aftereffects (which included the themes of Short Term Reduction in Anxiety, Persisting Insight, Assistance with Psychological Distress, and Inspired Behavioral Change). Participants maintained insights gained during their experience of psilocybin far beyond the course of the substance. This research suggests that the positive and persisting aftereffects related to the consumption of psilocybin may be useful for psychological healing and growth, and that these aftereffects should continue to be studied.Copyright © 2016, E-FLOW PDF NeuroQuantology.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Hallucinogens fall into several different classes, as broadly defined by pharmacological mechanism of action, and chemical structure. These include psychedelics, entactogens, dissociatives, and other atypical hallucinogens. Although these classes do not share a common primary mechanism of action, they do exhibit important similarities in their ability to occasion temporary but profound alterations of consciousness, involving acute changes in somatic, perceptual, cognitive, and affective processes. Such effects likely contribute to their recreational use. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that these drugs may have therapeutic applications beyond their potential for abuse. This review will present data on several classes of hallucinogens with a particular focus on psychedelics, entactogens, and dissociatives, for which clinical utility has been most extensively documented. Information on each class is presented in turn, tracing relevant historical insights, highlighting similarities and differences between the classes from the molecular to the behavioral level, and presenting the most up-to-date information on clinically oriented research with these substances, with important ramifications for their potential therapeutic value.Copyright © 2016 American Psychological Association.

N2  - Social ties are crucial for physical and mental health. However, psychiatric patients frequently encounter social rejection. Moreover, an increased reactivity to social exclusion influences the development, progression, and treatment of various psychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the neuromodulatory substrates of rejection experiences are largely unknown. The preferential serotonin (5-HT) 2A/1A receptor agonist, psilocybin (Psi), reduces the processing of negative stimuli, but whether 5-HT2A/1A receptor stimulation modulates the processing of negative social interactions remains unclear. Therefore, this double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over study assessed the neural response to social exclusion after the acute administration of Psi (0.215 mg/kg) or placebo (Pla) in 21 healthy volunteers by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting-state magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Participants reported a reduced feeling of social exclusion after Psi vs. Pla administration, and the neural response to social exclusion was decreased in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the middle frontal gyrus, key regions for social pain processing. The reduced neural response in the dACC was significantly correlated with Psi-induced changes in selfprocessing and decreased aspartate (Asp) content. In conclusion, 5-HT2A/1A receptor stimulation with psilocybin seems to reduce social pain processing in association with changes in self-experience. These findings may be relevant to the normalization of negative social interaction processing in psychiatric disorders characterized by increased rejection sensitivity. The current results also emphasize the importance of 5-HT2A/1A receptor subtypes and the Asp system in the control of social functioning, and as prospective targets in the treatment of sociocognitive impairments in psychiatric illnesses.

N2  - Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypical psychedelic drug, but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygen leveldependent (BOLD) measures, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSD's marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug's other characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather, decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of "ego-dissolution" and "altered meaning," implying the importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of "self" or "ego" and its processing of "meaning." Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute important new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and consciousness- altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain pathological states and potentially treat others.

N2  - Stimulation of serotonergic neurotransmission by psilocybin has been shown to shift emotional biases away from negative towards positive stimuli. We have recently shown that reduced amygdala activity during threat processing might underlie psilocybin's effect on emotional processing. However, it is still not known whether psilocybin modulates bottom-up or top-down connectivity within the visual-limbic-prefrontal network underlying threat processing. We therefore analyzed our previous fMRI data using dynamic causal modeling and used Bayesian model selection to infer how psilocybin modulated effective connectivity within the visual-limbic-prefrontal network during threat processing. First, both placebo and psilocybin data were best explained by a model in which threat affect modulated bidirectional connections between the primary visual cortex, amygdala, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Second, psilocybin decreased the threat-induced modulation of top-down connectivity from the amygdala to primary visual cortex, speaking to a neural mechanism that might underlie putative shifts towards positive affect states after psilocybin administration. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background Cluster headache (CH) patients often receive unsatisfactory treatment and may explore illicit substances as alternatives. We aimed to explore this use of illicit drugs for CH treatment. Methods We invited CH patients from an Internet-based self-help group to complete a questionnaire regarding their therapeutic use of illicit substances. Results Of the 54 respondents, 29 were classified as chronic and 39 were drug-resistant cases. Fifty patients had previously tried subcutaneous sumatriptan, 40 had tried O2, and 48 had tried at least one prophylactic treatment. All 54 patients specified that they were dissatisfied with conventional treatments. Thirty-four patients had used cannabinoids, 13 cocaine, 8 heroin, 18 psilocybin, 12 lysergic acid amide (LSA), and 4 lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Discussion Some patients with intractable CH decided to try illicit drugs concomitantly with cessation of medical care. Most of these patients found suggestions for illicit drug use on the Internet. Many patients seemed to underestimate the judicial consequences of, and had an overestimated confidence in the safety of, such illicit treatments. Physicians are often not informed by patients of their choice to use illicit drugs. This leads to questions regarding the true nature of the physician-patient relationship among dissatisfied CH patients.Copyright © International Headache Society 2015.

T1  - Ego-dissolution and psychedelics: Validation of the ego-dissolution inventory (EDI)

N2  - Aims: The experience of a compromised sense of "self", termed ego-dissolution, is a key feature of the psychedelic experience. This study aimed to validate the Ego-Dissolution Inventory (EDI), a new 8-item self-report scale designed to measure ego-dissolution. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the specificiy of the relationship between psychedelics and ego-dissolution. Method: Sixteen items relating to altered ego-consciousness were included in an internet questionnaire; eight relating to the experience of ego-dissolution (comprising the EDI), and eight relating to the antithetical experience of increased self-assuredness, termed ego-inflation. Items were rated using a visual analog scale. Participants answered the questionnaire for experiences with classical psychedelic drugs, cocaine and/or alcohol. They also answered the seven questions from the Mystical Experiences Questionnaire (MEQ) relating to the experience of unity with one's surroundings. Results: Six hundred and ninety-one participants completed the questionnaire, providing data for 1828 drug experiences (1043 psychedelics, 377 cocaine, 408 alcohol). Exploratory factor analysis demonstrated that the eight EDI items loaded exclusively onto a single common factor, which was orthogonal to a second factor comprised of the items relating to ego-inflation (rho = -0.110), demonstrating discriminant validity. The EDI correlated strongly with the MEQ-derived measure of unitive experience (rho = 0.735), demonstrating convergent validity. EDI internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha 0.93). Three analyses confirmed the specificity of ego-dissolution for experiences occasioned by psychedelic drugs. Firstly, EDI score correlated with drug-dose for psychedelic drugs (rho = 0.371), but not for cocaine (rho = 0.115) or alcohol (rho = -0.055). Secondly, the linear regression line relating the subjective intensity of the experience to ego-dissolution was significantly steeper for psychedelics (unstandardized regression coefficient = 0.701) compared with cocaine (0.135) or alcohol (0.144). Ego-inflation, by contrast, was specifically associated with cocaine experiences. Finally, a binary Support Vector Machine classifier identified experiences occasioned by psychedelic drugs vs. cocaine or alcohol with over 85% accuracy using ratings of ego-dissolution and ego-inflation alone. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the psychometric structure, internal consistency and construct validity of the EDI. Moreover, we demonstrate the close relationship between ego-dissolution and the psychedelic experience. The EDI will facilitate the study of the neuronal correlates of ego-dissolution, which is relevant for psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy and our understanding of psychosis.Copyright © 2016 Nour, Evans, Nutt and Carhart-Harris.

N2  - To date, pharmacological treatments for mood and anxiety disorders and for drug dependence show limited efficacy, leaving a large number of patients suffering severe and persistent symptoms. Preliminary studies in animals and humans suggest that ayahuasca, psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive properties. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of clinical trials published from 1990 until 2015, assessing these therapeutic properties. Electronic searches were performed using the PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO databases. Only clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals were included. Of these, 151 studies were identified, of which six met the established criteria. Reviewed studies suggest beneficial effects for treatment-resistant depression, anxiety and depression associated with life-threatening diseases, and tobacco and alcohol dependence. All drugs were well tolerated. In conclusion, ayahuasca, psilocybin and LSD may be useful pharmacological tools for the treatment of drug dependence, and anxiety and mood disorders, especially in treatment-resistant patients. These drugs may also be useful pharmacological tools to understand psychiatric disorders and to develop new therapeutic agents. However, all studies reviewed had small sample sizes, and half of them were open-label, proof-of-concept studies. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with more patients are needed to replicate these preliminary findings.Copyright © 2016, © The Author(s), 2016.

N2  - Life-threatening mushroom poisoning is rare in Germany. The diagnosis of mushroom poisoning is based on three criteria: identification of the mushroom ingested, the latency time between ingestion and onset of symptoms and finally, confirmation by clinical laboratory investigations. In the early stages a clinical differentiation between harmless and dangerous mushroom poisoning can be difficult for the summoned emergency doctor. A thorough collation of the course of events is, therefore, of particular importance. This article presents basic knowledge on the main groups of fungi and provides the reader with primary measures which must be undertaken in cases of mushroom poisoning. The most important fungal syndromes and the therapeutic options are presented.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - The taxonomic identification of the biological material contained in the hallucinogenic mushrooms culture media, was carried out using a DNA-based approach, thus highlighting the usefulness of this approach in the forensic identification of illegal samples also when they are present as basidiospores mixed in culture media and spore-bearing fruiting body are not present. This approach is very useful as it allows the unequivocal identification of potentially illicit material before the cultivation and it enables to stop the material to the Customs and to destroy it due to its dangerousness without cultivating the "grow-kits" and without instructing a criminal case. In fact, even if psilocin and psilocybin and the whole mushrooms are illegal in many countries, there is no specific indication in the law about the so called "grow-kits", containing the spores. To confirm the data obtained by the taxonomic identification, a simple, reliable, efficient LC-UV method, using tryptamine as internal standard, suitable for the forensic quali-quantitative determination of psilocin and psilocybin in hallucinogenic mushroom was optimized, validated and applied to the mushrooms grown after the cultivation of the grow-kits seized by the judicial authority, with the authorization of the Ministry of Health. A cation exchange column was used in a gradient elution mode (Phase A: 50 mM K2HPO4; 100 mM NaCl pH = 3 Phase B: methanol). The developed method was linear over the calibration range with a R2 > 0.9992 for both the analytes. The detection and quantification limits were respectively 0.01 and 0.1 mug/mL for psilocybin and 0.05 mug/mL and 0.1 mug/mL for psilocin and the intra- and inter-day precision was satisfactory (coefficients of variation <2.0% for both the analytes). The content of psilocybin in the mushrooms grown from the seized "grow-kits" ranged from 1.02 to 7.60 mg/g of dry vegetable material, while the content of psilocin from 0.415 to 8.36 mg/g.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Recreational drug use and human aggressive behavior: A comprehensive review since 2003

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Hundreds of studies have evaluated why drugs and aggression readily coexist and what static and transient physiological, environmental, and individual difference factors influence this relationship. While this literature is rapidly growing, there have been no comprehensive reviews on this relationship in the last decade. The present review summarizes the literature on the link between human aggressive behavior and alcohol, hallucinogens and psychedelics, methamphetamines, opioids, psychostimulants, anabolic-androgenic steroids, designer drugs, and depressants since 2003. Overall, studies show an unequivocal, causal, relationship between aggressive behavior and alcohol. Recent studies also find a positive relationship between cannabis use and aggressive behavior, although personality factors may mediate this relationship during intoxication. While research finds both cocaine and heroin to be strongly associated with aggressive behavior, this relationship is likely accounted for by third variable factors, such as personality traits and environmental influences. Studies also show increasing evidence that methamphetamines are associated with aggressive behavior during drug elimination and withdrawal. There is overwhelming experimental research suggesting that hallucinogens reduce aggressive behavior. Lastly, the relationship between morphine, codeine, designer drugs, and anabolic-androgenic steroids, ketamine, gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid or GHB and human aggression remains sparse and inconclusive. Policy implications are briefly discussed.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Treatment-refractory obsessive compulsive disorder
A1  - Atmaca M. 
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and debilitating disorder. As can be seen in other psychiatric disorders, refractoriness to treatment is an important problem for patients with OCD. OCD is a chronic disorder like collagen tissue disorders, with symptoms tending to wax and wane but rarely remitting spontaneously through the course of the disorder. An important part of OCD patients respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone or in combination with other medications, and cognitive behavior therapy. However, up to 30%-40% of patients do not respond to the available treatment modalities. The present paper tried to review the current state of knowledge on definition, clinical aspects, etiopathogenesis, and treatment strategies of patients with refractory OCD.Copyright © 2016

T1  - Return of the psychedelics: Psilocybin for treatment resistant depression
A1  - Patra S. 
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Psilocybin, the clinically most researched classic psychedelic has recently been tested for its safety and efficacy in a clinical population of treatment resistant depression. The efficacy of psilocybin in clinical depression previously demonstrated in the elecrophysiologic and neuroimaging findings as also in neuropsychological assessments is further validated by the findings of this rigorously conducted randomized trial. Mechanism of action of psilocybin and efficacy in treatment resistant depression are discussed in this paper. Ethical issues of conducting clinical trials with psychedelics are also discussed with particular emphasis on their relative safety and absence of addiction potential. Implications of these issues for conduct of larger trials for establishing risk benefit ratio in treatment resistant depression are further suggested.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic psychedelic drug that alters cognition in a characteristic way. It has been suggested that psychedelics expand the breadth of cognition via actions on the central nervous system. Previous work has shown changes in semantic processing under psilocybin (a related psychedelic to LSD) that are consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation. The present study investigates this further using a picture-naming task and the psychedelic, LSD. Ten participants completed the task under placebo and LSD. Results revealed significant effects of LSD on accuracy and error correction that were consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation under LSD. These results are consistent with a generalised "entropic" effect on the mind. We suggest incorporating direct neuroimaging measures in future studies, and to employ more naturalistic measures of semantic processing that may enhance ecological validity.Copyright © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Despite reports of apparent benefits, social and political pressure beginning in the late 1960s effectively banned scientific inquiry into psychedelic substances. Covert examination of psychedelics persisted through the 1990s; the turn of the century and especially the past 10 years, however, has seen a resurgent interest in psychedelic substances (eg, LSD, ayahuasca, psilocybin). This chapter outlines relevant EEG and brain imaging studies evaluating the effects of psychedelics on the brain. This chapter also reviews evidence of the use of psychedelics as adjunct therapy for a number of psychiatric and addictive disorders. In particular, psychedelics appear to have efficacy in treating depression and alcohol-use disorders.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Psilocybin is a psychodysleptic substance of natural origin present in the Psilocybe type mushrooms. Psychodysleptics are psychoactive substances which strongly affect the perception, mood and cognitive processes of a human. The mind-altering operation of psilocybin is based on stimulating the serotoninergic receptors, which leads to the increase in the concentration of serotonin in the brain and contributes to the intensification of the sensorimotor activity and perception. The effect of the operation of psilocybin on the human body are various changes in behaviour - frequent euphoria, cheerfulness, the feeling of lightness and unity with the surrounding world. Additionally, psilocybin causes perception modification not imitating reality, often mistaken for hallucinations. The operation of psilocybin may be compared to the operation of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), yet many times weaker. Psilocybin may be found on the list of intoxicants in the I-P group, namely substances with no medical applications and with a high potential of overusing, which are excluded from the pharmaceutical trade and may be used solely for scientific purposes. However, the properties of psilocybin make it possible to consider its use in medicine. Ailments, in which the use of this substance brings measurable effects, include depression. Studies conducted on volunteers show that psilocybin may be a good alternative to the currently available antidepressants - its effectiveness was observed and very low toxicity confirmed.Copyright © Medical Communications Sp. z o.o.

T1  - Correlates of new psychoactive substance use among a self-selected sample of nightclub attendees in the United States

N2  - Background and Objectives: Although new psychoactive substances (NPS) continue to emerge at a rapid rate, US national surveys only measure the use of non-specific categories of NPS and are not designed to access high-risk populations. In this paper we report lifetime use of specific NPS (of 58) and examine correlates of use among a high-risk population: nightlife attendees. Methods: The self-selected sample from the Global Drug Survey (2013) consisted of 2,282 respondents in the US, aged 16-60 years, who reported nightclub attendance in the last year. Multivariable logistic regression models determined unique predictors of lifetime use. Results: Lifetime use of a wide range of NPS was reported (any NPS; 46.4%), including synthetic cannabinoids (24.8%), tryptamines (eg, 4-AcO-DMT, 23.0%), psychedelic phenethylamines (eg, 2C-B, 25I-NBOMe; 21.7%), euphoric stimulants (eg, BenzoFury; 16.2%), and synthetic cathinones (eg, methylone; 10.5%). Females (AOR = 0.49 [.41,.60]) and older respondents (age 22-60; AOR =.73 [.59,.89]) were at lower odds of reporting any lifetime NPS use. Frequent nightclub attendance was associated with increased odds of reporting lifetime NPS use overall (eg, weekly compared with less than once a month, AOR = 2.33 [1.70,3.19]), but not specifically with synthetic cannabinoid use. Discussion and Conclusions: Among a self-selected sample of nightclub attendees, a large range of novel substances were reported, and young attendees, males, and those who attended more frequently were at increased odds of reporting use. Scientific Significance: Harm reduction initiatives are needed to reduce risk of harm in this population, where environmental characteristics may augment risks associated with consuming lesser-known psychoactive substances.

N2  - Compounds in some plants have remarkable effects on the central nervous system. Plants containing those compounds are mind altering or psychoactive in nature. These are consumed in the form of simple or complex preparations to affect the mind or alter the state of consciousness. Psychoactivity may include sedative, stimulant, euphoric, deliriant, and hallucinogenic effects. Several hundred psychoactive plants are known. Some important examples of psychoactive plants include Datura, Salvia, and Cannabis. Psychoactive plants have been used ritually, medicinally, and recreationally for thousands of years. Hence, the sociocultural and economic significance of psychoactive plants is enormous.Copyright © 2016, Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt. Ltd. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Hallucinogen Persistent Perception Disorder (HPPD) is considered an "uncommon" disorder described in association with use of hallucinogens such as LSD, mescaline and psilocybin. Despite multiple mentions of persistence of visual disturbances reported by users on online forums, clinicians may not be aware of this complication. There have been few descriptions of HPPD in association with use of new psychoactive substances (such as 2C-E). Increasing use of these designer stimulants places greater numbers at risk for psychiatric morbidities including HPPD. Here we report the first documented case of HPPD due to high dose 2C-E and blunting of symptoms with addition of lamotrigine.Copyright © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Unconscious processes have long been forgotten in neuroscientific field for their difficult objectification. Gradually, they have become a subject of investigation in cognitive neuroscience, that uncovers their importance in decision-making and behavior. However, cognitive neuroscience research has difficulties to take into account the dynamics of unconscious processes, their affective valence and subjectivity. Current psychedelic research (research of altered states of consciousness induced by hallucinogens) attempts to consider these aspects as it uses neuroimaging methods together with the subjective testimonies of participants and thus represents a very promising tool for better understanding of the unconscious and conscious states of the human mind.

T1  - Exploring Hallucinogen Pharmacology and Psychedelic Medicine with Zebrafish Models
A1  - Kyzar E.J.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - After decades of sociopolitical obstacles, the field of psychiatry is experiencing a revived interest in the use of hallucinogenic agents to treat brain disorders. Along with the use of ketamine for depression, recent pilot studies have highlighted the efficacy of classic serotonergic hallucinogens, such as lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin, in treating addiction, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety. However, many basic pharmacological and toxicological questions remain unanswered with regard to these compounds. In this study, we discuss psychedelic medicine as well as the behavioral and toxicological effects of hallucinogenic drugs in zebrafish. We emphasize this aquatic organism as a model ideally suited to assess both the potential toxic and therapeutic effects of major known classes of hallucinogenic compounds. In addition, novel drugs with hallucinogenic properties can be efficiently screened using zebrafish models. Well-designed preclinical studies utilizing zebrafish can contribute to the reemerging treatment paradigm of psychedelic medicine, leading to new avenues of clinical exploration for psychiatric disorders.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To highlight the insensate delusions of Truman Show Syndrome. METHODS: Case Study: 20 year old right-handed, single, African American male complains of, since the age of 7, feeling like he is the central character in the movie The Truman Show, where everyone is watching him and everyone (except immediate family) have been replaced by actors. Moreover, the physical objects around him have been replaced by artificial cardboard movie scenery. He repetitively touches surrounding furniture and objects in order to validate their true nature. He believes that the physical environment surrounding him is fake, as if "in an experiment, or in the movie The Matrix". When estivating and flying to a new city, he perceives the fellow travelers, flight attendants, and pilots as actors and the plane and city itself are all elaborate props in his personal drama. He admits ideas of references, whereby glances from strangers suggest to him that he is being watched as the protagonist of this elaborate scheme. As a result, he avoids social gatherings and groups. Confiding in his parents received reassurance. Querying his close companions as to their occupation as actors is pleasantly rebuffed as if it is humorous. When the monothematic delusions are present, he feels overwhelmed saying "if the delusional thought of being the star of the Truman Show enters my thought process, I can not derail my own thought train". Approximately 70% of the time, he has insight as to the delusional nature of his condition and 30% of the time he is submerged in the pathological belief system. Intensity of the delusion is enhanced by lack of sleep and markedly exacerbated by marijuana, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), and psilocybin mushrooms. He affirms occasional auditory hypnogogic hallucinations as well as when surrounded by a large crowd, at which time he notes nondescript noises and his name being called in a mechanical voice. His past medical history is relevant for head trauma with loss of consciousness at age 9 and recurrent syncope while playing a thoracic compression game, "Pass Out Challenge", with friends. RESULTS: Birth, developmental, family, social history, and general physical exam are normal. Normal neurologic exam includes gait, cerebellar, sensory, &reflexes.-Abnormalities: Motor Exam: Right Pronator Drift.-Ancillary Tests include: Clock drawing test 4/4; Semantic Fluency Test: 33; Beck Depression Inventory type II: 29; Beck Anxiety Inventory: 16; Alcohol Sniff Test: 17. TREATMENT: Despite Aripiprazole, he did not follow up with the presumption that the medical team was also included in his delusion. CONCLUSION: Unlike other misidentification delusional syndromes like Capgras or Fergoli's, not only are the people replaced with 'imposters' but inanimate objects are also incorporated in the Truman Show delusion. Queries should be conducted as to the extent of the delusion systems in those who present with this syndrome.

N2  - Introduction: Currently only five simple tryptamines are worldwide regulated as hallucinogenic substances: psilocin (4-HODMT), psilocybin (4-PO-DMT), N,N-diethyltryptamine (DET or T-9), N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and a-ethyltryptamine (etryptamine or a-ET). DMT is present in natural preparations like ayahuasca or Psicotria viridis and psilocybin and psilocin are the main components of hallucinogenic mushrooms [1]. Noncontrolled tryptamines effects are considered similar to those of the already controlled tryptamines such as psilocybin or DMT [1]. These molecules are similar to regulated psychoactives and are offered as a non-illegal alternative to them [2]. However, there is not enough scientific evidence assessing potential differences in their epidemiology and potential differences. Objectives: (1) To evaluate the presence of psychoactive tryptamines among samples delivered to and analyzed by the Spanish harm reduction service Energy Control, (2) to compare the amount of regulated and non-regulated tryptamines delivered and (3) to compare the results of the analysis. Materials and Methods: All samples delivered as simple psychoactive tryptamines from 2006 to 2015 delivered to Energy Control were analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. A cross-sectional descriptive analysis of the samples was then conducted. Results: From 25,296 samples delivered during the years of study 436 (1.72%) were delivered as hallucinogenic tryptamines. Out of the total 436 tryptamines samples, 232 (53.21%) were non-regulated tryptamines. Analysis revealed that 150 samples (64.7%) contained one single unadulterated substance; 57 samples (24.6%) contained the substance delivered plus another psychoactive tryptamine; 5 samples (2.2%) contained other substances different from tryptamines and in 5 samples (2.2%) no active substances were found. Out of the total 436 tryptamines samples, 204 (46.79%) were regulated tryptamines. The analysis revealed that 128 samples (62.7%) contained one single unadulterated substance; 43 samples (21.1%) contained the substance delivered plus another psychoactive tryptamine or other expected substances from processing; 7 samples (3.4%) contained other substances different from tryptamines and in 22 samples (10.8%) no active substances were found. Conclusion: During the whole period of study a slightly higher number of non-regulated psychoactive tryptamines was delivered. Percentages of samples containing only one unadulterated substance are consistent with other national studies on other NPS using convenience samples [3]. However, very few substances delivered as tryptamines were found to contain substances different from psychoactive tryptamines leading to think that sources are highly reliable regarding the content. Results of analysis of new regulated tryptamines was more consistent with the sample delivered than that of classical tryptamines. Further monitoring of these substances should be maintained in order to assess future trends. It would be interesting in further studies to analyze the different effects of the different hallucinogenic tryptamines molecules in order to evaluate the implications of samples adulteration.

N2  - Psilocybin is a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist that occurs naturally in certain mushroom species. Recent studies have assessed the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for a variety of conditions, including: end of life anxiety [1], obsessive compulsive disorder [2] and smoking [3] and alcohol dependence [4], with promising preliminary results. The present study aimed to investigate psilocybin's safety and efficacy in patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression. In this open-label feasibility trial, 12 patients (6 females) with moderate to severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. Psychological support was provided before, during and after each session. Depressive symptoms were assessed with standard assessments from 1 week to 3 months posttreatment, with the QIDS-16 serving as the primary outcome. Treatment was well-tolerated by all of the patients. No unexpected and only a small number of minor adverse events were observed. Relative to baseline, depressive symptoms were markedly reduced 1 week (mean QIDS difference = -11.8, 95% CI, -5 to -17, Cohen's d = 3.4) and 3 months post-treatment (mean QIDS difference = -9.2, 95% CI, +3 to -17, Cohen's d = 2.3). Marked and sustained improvements in anxiety and anhedonia were also observed. This study provides preliminary support for the safety and efficacy of a novel intervention for treatment-resistant depression. It should motivate further trials, with more rigorous designs, to better examine the therapeutic potential of this approach.

N2  - Introduction: Psilocybin and its active metabolite psilocin are classical tryptamine hallucinogens. The neurochemical basis of their effects is related to the stimulation of serotonin 5-HT1A a 5-HT2A/C receptors. Intoxication induces significant alterations in perception, thought disturbance and emotional processing - effects that mimic psychotic symptoms. Although these symptoms are only partially transferable to rats, the brain activity assessed by quantitative EEG (QEEG) has translational validity. Aim of the study: The objective of the study was to compare changes in QEEG induced by psilocybin during the resting state in humans and by psilocin during behavioral inactivity in freely moving rats. Methods: In a double blind placebo-controlled design, 20 healthy volunteers were administered an oral dose of psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) and were subjected to resting-state EEG recordings at baseline and at the intoxication peak (90 minutes after ingestion). The effect of intoxication was evaluated on EEG power spectra, coherence and on current density using sLORETA (standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography). In the animal part of the study, we measured quantitative EEG in freely moving rats after administration of psilocin. Fourteen electrodes (12 active) were stereotactically implanted to the surface of the rats' cortex and were fixed to the rat's skull with dental cement. Behavioral activity was co-registered along with the EEG. Only signals corresponding to inactivity were used in the further analysis. Data was transformed by Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) and spectral and coherence analyses were performed. The statistical analysis was performed using paired t-tests (comparison the drug effect and the baseline recordings). Summary of results: Psilocybin in humans induced a decrement in relative alpha spectral power and strongly increased high beta and gamma power. LORETA localized the alpha decrease to the occipital lobe and posterior midline structures, while the increases in fast activity were most pronounced in large frontotemporo- occipital areas. Furthermore, decreased EEG coherences in theta, alpha and beta bands were observed, mainly between the frontal and temporal areas. Psilocin in rats decreased the relative spectral power in theta band and caused increases in higher frequencies (beta and gamma) in rats. A broadband decrement in EEG coherences was observed with the most significant changes observable in lower frequencies. Conclusions: The decrement of basic alpha activity in posterior midline structures in humans after psilocybin administration are related to a characteristic feature of altered states of consciousness - the transformative experience of ego-dissolution. The strong activation of large association brain areas (increase in gamma) might be an underlying process of perceptual and cognitive changes. Disconnection is one of the core neurobiological features underlying psychosis. Both animal and human data showed several parallels - a decrease in basic brain activity (alpha in human, theta in rats) and disconnection of long projections. Therefore our results confirmed the translational validity of animal EEG during behavioral inactivity and resting state EEG in humans.

N2  - Background: Psilocybin is a modulator of amygdala activity presumably via its 5HT1A/2A agonistic properties. We have recently shown that reduced amygdala activity during threat processing might underlie psilocybin's effect on emotional processing in a block-design paradigm [1]. In this study, we investigated psilocybin's effects in an event-related face discrimination task in n = 18 healthy volunteers who received psilocybin and placebo in a crossover design. Face discrimination of emotional faces relies on both prefrontal as well as subcortical structures, namely the amygdala. We hypothesized that the amygdala activity alone or as part of a network is altered during psilocybin application. This could manifest in altered salience of emotional face-processing in task activity or in task-related connectivity of the amygdala. Methods: Using a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, cross-over design, subjects received either placebo or 0.16 mg/kg oral psilocybin in two separate imaging sessions at least 14 days apart (as reported in [1]). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging, beta-series connectivity and graphtheory network analysis to characterize effective connectivity during categorization of angry, fearful or happy affective faces in contrast to affective neutral faces in the brain. As the amygdala is a key target for psilocybin's effect during emotion processing, we used the left and right amygdala as alpha-priori region-of-interest seed masks for the connectivity analysis. Results: Psilocybin (in contrast to placebo) increased reaction time for all three categories of affective stimuli in comparison to neutral stimuli. The rate of correctly recognized hits did not differ between face categories and between placebo and psilocybin. The face discrimination task demonstrated in the placebo condition a robust signal of visual cortex, fusiform cortex, limbic system namely the amygdala, prefrontal and motor cortices. During the face categorization task, there was a tendency for a stronger striatal activation during the angry face condition under psilocybin, but no difference for fearful or happy faces. During psilocybin, a beta-series connectivity analysis of the left-amygdala seed ROI showed a decrease in the connectivity with the striatum (mainly left putamen, cluster-corrected pFDR<0.03). This was not found during the happy or fearful face condition. On a behavioural level, the rate of correct classified angry faces correlated with the coupling between amygdala and putamen. The coupling correlated negatively with the sum score of altered states (TAS: r = 0.57, p = 0.015) and with anxiety (r = 0.51, p = 0.03) during psilocybin intake. Conclusion: In summary, psilocybin alters subcortical limbic networks during processing of angry faces in comparison to neutral faces. During psilocybin, the coupling between amygdala and putamen is decreased. This points to a change in salienceevaluation of angry faces, which is partly supported by the behavioral effect. The stronger coupling between amygdala and putamen during angry face discrimination, the lower the anxiety rating during psilocybin. Therefore, our results support further that psilocybin not only alters amygdala activity but exerts downward effects in the striatum.

N2  - Background: Psychedelics, or classic serotonin-2a receptor agonist hallucinogens (e.g. psilocybin and LSD), are being investigated for their therapeutic potential in patients with mood disorders and addiction. Strong psychoactive effects during psychedelic sessions, including decreases in a sense of self and increases in ratings of connectedness, positive mood, ineffability, and timelessness (operationalized as a "mystical experience") can be followed by sustained therapeutic changes, including improvement of depressive symptoms and reduction or cessation of addictive behaviors. Brain imaging studies using several different imaging modalities have identified changes in the activity and connectivity of regions of the posterior and ventral default mode network (DMN) during acute psychedelic effects. While these acute effects of psychedelics on the brain have been associated with subjective effects of spiritual experience and a decreased sense of self, little is known about the sustained effects of psychedelics on brain activity and connectivity after the acute effects of psychedelics have subsided. Thus, knowledge about the neurobiological basis of sustained therapeutic changes after psychedelic sessions is limited. The current double-blind, placebo-controlled study aimed to examine the relationship between acute psilocybin subjective effects and subsequent (next-day) differences in resting-state DMN connectivity. Methods: 18 volunteers (Age = 25-70, M = 54.2, SD = 12.6; 10 F/8 M) in a study of the effects of psilocybin on meditation were randomized to receive either a placebo (n = 9) or a high dose (25 mg/70 kg) psilocybin (n = 9) capsule before a laboratory session. Groups were matched on age (?2 = 0.9, p = n.s.), sex (t = 1.01, p = n.s.), number of previous hallucinogen uses (t = 0.07, p = n.s.), and estimated lifetime hours of meditation (t = 1.40, p = n.s.). Self-report measures of subjective experience (including the Mystical Experience Questionnaire, or MEQ, and the Challenging Experience Questionnaire, or CEQ) were assessed at the end of the session (after the effects of psilocybin had subsided). Seven minutes of resting-state fMRI data were collected the day after the session using a 3T Achieva Philips MRI scanner and echo planar imaging (TR = 2s, 37 slices, resolution = 3mm3, slice gap = 1mm, matrix = 80x80). Resting state data were preprocessed and normalized to the MNI template using SPM, screened for gross motion (Power et. al, 2012), and artifact-corrected using volume sensoring (Power et al, 2014) and 36-parameter motion correction (Satterthwaite et. al, 2013) which includes aCompCor (Behzadi et. al, 2007). Seed-based functional connectivity analyses were applied to resting-state data using the CONN toolbox. Resting-state data were parcellated using regions of interest (ROIs) defined in the Brodmann area atlas as well as additional amygdala and hippocampus ROIs defined in the Anatomy toolbox in SPM. Self-report measures and functional connectivity of DMN regions to all other ROIs were compared between placebo and psilocybin groups and correlated within the psilocybin group. Functional connectivity results were corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR, po 0.05). Results: Participants who received psilocybin scored significantly higher than those who received placebo on the MEQ and the CEQ. There were no main effects of drug condition on functional connectivity, however in those who received psilocybin, there was a significant association between MEQ scores and connectivity of DMN regions (including the posterior cingulate and lateral parietal cortices) to both executive (dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex) and limbic (amygdala) brain regions. There was also a significant association between CEQ scores and connectivity of medial temporal lobe regions, including the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus in those who received psilocybin. Conclusions: Long-term therapeutic change observed after mystical and challenging experiences with psilocybin may be related to DMN, executive, and limbic connectivity change. Sustained change in DMN connectivity is consistent with therapeutic changes observed after psychedelic sessions. The relationship between challenging experiences, limbic connectivity, and therapeutic outcomes should be further investigated.

N2  - 17 million adults in the United States ages 18 and older had an alcohol use disorder (AUD) in 2012. Current FDA-approved treatments for AUD are limited to disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate, and many patients are refractory to these treatments. Hallucinogenic drugs were used in the 1960s to treat AUD, and a number of studies supporting their use were published. Moreover, recent studies have documented impressive effects of psilocybin for tobacco cessation and ayahuasca for the prevention of ethanol-induced behavioral sensitization. Therefore, herein, we investigated the effects of the serotonin 2A receptor agonist and hallucinogen 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) in ethanol-induced place conditioning and 2-bottle choice ethanol consumption in mice, 2 widely accepted animal models of ethanol abuse. We found that DOI pretreatment prevented the development of an ethanol-induced place preference, and moreover, DOI treatment after ethanol prevented the consolidation of such conditioning. DOI treatment robustly decreased ethanol consumption without affecting total fluid intake, and interestingly, this effect was most profound in subjects that exhibited high ethanol consumption. As there are clear clinical limitations to the use of hallucinogenic drugs, we went on to explore whether computational chemistry approaches could be used to develop biased agonists of serotonin 2A receptors with reduced hallucinogenic activity, and whether such compounds suppressed ethanol consumption. These studies document a new model system in which we can now investigate the neurobiological and pharmacological mechanisms through which hallucinogens reduce ethanol consumption and appetitive conditioning.

N2  - Introduction Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) is a syndrome characterized by prolonged or reoccurring perceptual symptoms, reminiscent of acute hallucinogen effects. HPPD was associated with a broader range of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide)-like substances, including cannabis, MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), psilocybin, mescaline and other psychostimulants. Symptomatology mainly comprises visual disorders (i.e., geometric pseudo-hallucinations, halos, flashes of colours/lights, motion-perception deficits, afterimages, micropsy, more acute awareness of floaters, etc.), even though depressive symptoms and thought disorders may be comorbidly present. Objective Although HPPD was firstly described in 1954, it was definitely established as a syndrome in 2000 with the revised forth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). However, neuronal substrate, risk factors, aetiology and pathogenesis of HPPD remains still unknown and under investigation. Furthermore, there are still open questions about its pharmacological targets. Aims A critical review on psychopathological bases, etiological hypothesis and psychopharmacological approaches towards HPPD was here provided. Methods A systematic literature search on PubMed/Medline, GoogleScholar and Scopus databases without time restrictions, by using a specific set of keywords was here carried out. In addition, a case report was here described. Results and conclusions Pharmacological and clinical issues are here considered and practical psychopharmacological recommendations and clinical guidelines here suggested.

N2  - PURPOSE: This poster presents a novel clinical protocol for psychedelic-assisted group psychotherapy for psychosocial distress associated with life-threatening illness. All current clinical research with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy is done in an individual modality. We propose a group psychotherapy modality that we are preparing to empirically test. METHODS: We utilize a translational approach to clinical intervention design that harnesses findings from psychiatric anthropology, which has at its core the empiric analysis of group behavior and healing rituals. In addition to basing our design on the psycho-oncology literature and clinical experience, our group psychotherapy design is derived from our team's ethnographic experience with Brazilian ayahuasca religions as well as Mexican 12-Step mutual aid groups for depression, trauma and substance use. We also draw heavily from midcentury and current literature on psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (particularly with psilocybin), which has shown promising results for treating psychosocial distress associated with cancer diagnoses. RESULTS: Our protocol employs the natural product and 5HT-2A/C receptor agonist, psilocybin, as a psychotherapeutic catalyst within the context of a time-limited, group psychotherapy (whose manual is still currently in development). We combine therapeutic techniques from standard group psychotherapies for patients with life-threatening diagnoses, established protocols for psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, and aspects of mutual aid that we hypothesize will facilitate a group structure that promotes safe and productive group process and the resolution of psychosocial distress. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first modern, open-label, pilot study design and methodology for examining the effects of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy on psychosocial distress associated with life-threatening illness. Our intervention is responds to recent calls to better integrate spirituality into palliative care. Our approach to a psilocybin-induced spiritual intervention also retains greater face-validity because of its communal aspect-given that traditional healing rituals involving the ingestion of psychedelic plants typically occur in groups to enhance social support and meaning-making. Research Implications: Despite centuries of documented folk therapeutic use of psychedelic plants in group settings by communities around the world, and despite dozens of scientific publications on psychedelic-assisted group psychotherapy (conducted in the US, Europe and Latin America during the 1950s-1990s), no current research on psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy is examining the safety and efficacy of employing this experimental modality of care in a group setting. Clinical Implications: If psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for psychosocial distress becomes a more accessible treatment modality in the future, it will be essential to assess different "delivery systems" (a.k.a., psychotherapy formats) to determine the optimum method of administration. This is especially true given the known dependence of psychedelic-induced experiences on what is known in the literature as "set and setting".

T1  - Psychedelics not linked to mental health problems or suicidal behavior: A population study
A1  - Johansen P.-O.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - A recent large population study of 130,000 adults in the United States failed to find evidence for a link between psychedelic use (lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin or mescaline) and mental health problems. Using a new data set consisting of 135,095 randomly selected United States adults, including 19,299 psychedelic users, we examine the associations between psychedelic use and mental health. After adjusting for sociodemographics, other drug use and childhood depression, we found no significant associations between lifetime use of psychedelics and increased likelihood of past year serious psychological distress, mental health treatment, suicidal thoughts, suicidal plans and suicide attempt, depression and anxiety. We failed to find evidence that psychedelic use is an independent risk factor for mental health problems. Psychedelics are not known to harm the brain or other body organs or to cause addiction or compulsive use; serious adverse events involving psychedelics are extremely rare. Overall, it is difficult to see how prohibition of psychedelics can be justified as a public health measure.Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.

T1  - Psilocybin-induced spiritual experiences and insightfulness are associated with synchronization of neuronal oscillations

N2  - Rationale: During the last years, considerable progress has been made toward understanding the neuronal basis of consciousness by using sophisticated behavioral tasks, brain-imaging techniques, and various psychoactive drugs. Nevertheless, the neuronal mechanisms underlying some of the most intriguing states of consciousness, including spiritual experiences, remain unknown. Objectives: To elucidate state of consciousness-related neuronal mechanisms, human subjects were given psilocybin, a naturally occurring serotonergic agonist and hallucinogen that has been used for centuries to induce spiritual experiences in religious and medical rituals. Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 50 healthy human volunteers received a moderate dose of psilocybin, while high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were taken during eyes-open and eyes-closed resting states. The current source density and the lagged phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations across distributed brain regions were computed and correlated with psilocybin-induced altered states of consciousness. Results: Psilocybin decreased the current source density of neuronal oscillations at 1.5-20 Hz within a neural network comprising the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices and the parahippocampal regions. Most intriguingly, the intensity levels of psilocybin-induced spiritual experience and insightfulness correlated with the lagged phase synchronization of delta oscillations (1.5-4 Hz) between the retrosplenial cortex, the parahippocampus, and the lateral orbitofrontal area. Conclusions: These results provide systematic evidence for the direct association of a specific spatiotemporal neuronal mechanism with spiritual experiences and enhanced insight into life and existence. The identified mechanism may constitute a pathway for modulating mental health, as spiritual experiences can promote sustained well-being and psychological resilience.Copyright © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Background The amygdala is a key structure in serotonergic emotion-processing circuits. In healthy volunteers, acute administration of the serotonin 1A/2A/2C receptor agonist psilocybin reduces neural responses to negative stimuli and induces mood changes toward positive states. However, it is little-known whether psilocybin reduces amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli and whether any change in amygdala reactivity is related to mood change. Methods This study assessed the effects of acute administration of the hallucinogen psilocybin (.16 mg/kg) versus placebo on amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli in 25 healthy volunteers using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Mood changes were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A double-blind, randomized, cross-over design was used with volunteers counterbalanced to receive psilocybin and placebo in two separate sessions at least 14 days apart. Results Amygdala reactivity to negative and neutral stimuli was lower after psilocybin administration than after placebo administration. The psilocybin-induced attenuation of right amygdala reactivity in response to negative stimuli was related to the psilocybin-induced increase in positive mood state. Conclusions These results demonstrate that acute treatment with psilocybin decreased amygdala reactivity during emotion processing and that this was associated with an increase of positive mood in healthy volunteers. These findings may be relevant to the normalization of amygdala hyperactivity and negative mood states in patients with major depression.Copyright © 2015 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

N2  - Cluster headache is one of the most debilitating pain syndromes. A significant number of patients are refractory to conventional therapies. The Clusterbusters.org medication use survey sought to characterize the effects of both conventional and alternative medications used in cluster headache. Participants were recruited from cluster headache websites and headache clinics. The final analysis included responses from 496 participants. The survey was modeled after previously published surveys and was available online. Most responses were chosen from a list, though others were free-texted. Conventional abortive and preventative medications were identified and their efficacies agreed with those previously published. The indoleamine hallucinogens, psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide, and lysergic acid amide, were comparable to or more efficacious than most conventional medications. These agents were also perceived to shorten/abort a cluster period and bring chronic cluster headache into remission more so than conventional medications. Furthermore, infrequent and non-hallucinogenic doses were reported to be efficacious. Findings provide additional evidence that several indoleamine hallucinogens are rated as effective in treating cluster headache. These data reinforce the need for further investigation of the effects of these and related compounds in cluster headache under experimentally controlled settings.Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - The definition New psychoactive substances (NPS) refers to emerging drugs whose chemical structures are similar to other psychoactive compounds but not identical, representing a "legal" alternative to internationally controlled drugs. There are many categories of NPS, such as synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, phenylethylamines, piperazines, ketamine derivatives and tryptamines. Tryptamines are naturally occurring compounds, which can derive from the amino acid tryptophan by several biosynthetic pathways: their structure is a combination of a benzene ring and a pyrrole ring, with the addition of a 2-carbon side chain. Tryptamines include serotonin and melatonin as well as other compounds known for their hallucinogenic properties, such as psilocybin in 'Magic mushrooms' and dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in Ayahuasca brews. Aim: To review the scientific literature regarding tryptamines and their derivatives, providing a summary of all the available information about the structure of these compounds, their effects in relationship with the routes of administration, their pharmacology and toxicity, including articles reporting cases of death related to intake of these substances. Methods: A comprehensive review of the published scientific literature was performed, using also non peer-reviewed information sources, such as books, government publications and drug user web fora. Conclusions: Information from Internet and from published scientific literature, organized in the way we proposed in this review, provides an effective tool for specialists facing the emerging NPS threat to public health and public security, including the personnel working in Emergency Department.Copyright © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.

T1  - Peak experiences and the afterglow phenomenon: When and how do therapeutic effects of hallucinogens depend on psychedelic experiences?

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelic substances has recently resumed. During an early phase of human psychedelic research, their therapeutic application in different pathologies had been suggested, and the first evidence for efficacy was provided. The range of recent clinical applications of psychedelics spans from cluster headaches and obsessive-compulsive disorder to addiction and the treatment of fear and anxiety in patients suffering from terminal illness, indicating potentially different therapeutic mechanisms. A variety of approaches in psychotherapy emphasize subjective experiences, such as so-called peak experiences or afterglow phenomena, as differentially mediating therapeutic action. This review aims to re-evaluate earlier and recent concepts of how psychedelic substances may exert beneficial effects. After a short outline of neurophenomenological aspects, we discuss different approaches to how psychedelics are used in psychotherapy. Finally, we summarize evidence for the relationship between subjective experiences and therapeutic success. While the distinction between pharmacological and psychological action obviously cannot be clear-cut, they do appear to contribute differently from each other when their effects are compared with regard to pathologies.Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.

N2  - Mental health problems are endemic across the globe, and suicide, a strong corollary of poor mental health, is a leading cause of death. Classic psychedelic use may occasion lasting improvements in mental health, but the effects of classic psychedelic use on suicidality are unknown. We evaluated the relationships of classic psychedelic use with psychological distress and suicidality among over 190,000 USA adult respondents pooled from the last five available years of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2008-2012) while controlling for a range of covariates. Lifetime classic psychedelic use was associated with a significantly reduced odds of past month psychological distress (weighted odds ratio (OR)=0.81 (0.72-0.91)), past year suicidal thinking (weighted OR=0.86 (0.78-0.94)), past year suicidal planning (weighted OR=0.71 (0.54-0.94)), and past year suicide attempt (weighted OR=0.64 (0.46-0.89)), whereas lifetime illicit use of other drugs was largely associated with an increased likelihood of these outcomes. These findings indicate that classic psychedelics may hold promise in the prevention of suicide, supporting the view that classic psychedelics' most highly restricted legal status should be reconsidered to facilitate scientific study, and suggesting that more extensive clinical research with classic psychedelics is warranted.Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.

N2  - Several lines of evidence suggest that classic (5HT2A agonist) hallucinogens have clinically relevant effects in alcohol and drug addiction. Although recent studies have investigated the effects of psilocybin in various populations, there have been no studies on the efficacy of psilocybin for alcohol dependence. We conducted a single-group proof-of-concept study to quantify acute effects of psilocybin in alcohol-dependent participants and to provide preliminary outcome and safety data. Ten volunteers with DSM-IV alcohol dependence received orally administered psilocybin in one or two supervised sessions in addition to Motivational Enhancement Therapy and therapy sessions devoted to preparation for and debriefing from the psilocybin sessions. Participants' responses to psilocybin were qualitatively similar to those described in other populations. Abstinence did not increase significantly in the first 4 weeks of treatment (when participants had not yet received psilocybin), but increased significantly following psilocybin administration (p < 0.05). Gains were largely maintained at follow-up to 36 weeks. The intensity of effects in the first psilocybin session (at week 4) strongly predicted change in drinking during weeks 5-8 (r = 0.76 to r = 0.89) and also predicted decreases in craving and increases in abstinence self-efficacy during week 5. There were no significant treatment-related adverse events. These preliminary findings provide a strong rationale for controlled trials with larger samples to investigate efficacy and mechanisms.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02061293Copyright © The Author(s) 2015.

N2  - Psilocin (3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-1H-indol-4-ol) is a hallucinogenic component of the Mexican mushroom Psilocybe mexicana and a skeletal serotonin (5-HT) analogue. Psilocin is the active metabolite of psilocybin (3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-1H-indol-4-yl dihydrogen phosphate). In the present study, we examined the effects of systemically administered psilocin on extracellular dopamine and 5-HT concentrations in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens, and medial prefrontal cortex of the dopaminergic pathway in awake rats using in vivo microdialysis. Intraperitoneal administration of psilocin (5, 10 mg/kg) significantly increased extracellular dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens. Psilocin did not affect the extracellular 5-HT level in the nucleus accumbens. Conversely, systemic administration of psilocin (10 mg/kg) significantly increased extracellular 5-HT levels in the medial prefrontal cortex of rats, but dopamine was decreased in this region. However, neither extracellular dopamine nor 5-HT levels in the VTA were altered by administration of psilocin. Behaviorally, psilocin significantly increased the number of head twitches. Thus, psilocin affects the dopaminergic system in the nucleus accumbens. In the serotonergic system, psilocin contribute to a crucial effect in the medial prefrontal cortex. The present data suggest that psilocin increased both the extracellular dopamine and 5-HT concentrations in the mesoaccumbens and/or mesocortical pathway.Copyright © 2015 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Introduction: The American continent is very rich in psychoactive plants and fungi, and many pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures used them for magical, therapeutic and religious purposes. Objectives: The archaeological, ethno-historical and ethnographic evidence of the use of hallucinogenic substances in Mesoamerica is reviewed. Results: Hallucinogenic cactus, plants and mushrooms were used to induce altered states of consciousness in healing rituals and religious ceremonies. The Maya drank balche (a mixture of honey and extracts of Lonchocarpus) in group ceremonies to achieve intoxication. Ritual enemas and other psychoactive substances were also used to induce states of trance. Olmec, Zapotec, Maya and Aztec used peyote, hallucinogenic mushrooms (teonanacatl: Psilocybe spp) and the seeds of ololiuhqui (Turbina corymbosa), that contain mescaline, psilocybin and lysergic acid amide, respectively. The skin of the toad Bufo spp contains bufotoxins with hallucinogenic properties, and was used since the Olmec period. Jimson weed (Datura stramonium), wild tobacco (Nicotiana rustica), water lily (Nymphaea ampla) and Salvia divinorum were used for their psychoactive effects. Mushroom stones dating from 3000 BC have been found in ritual contexts in Mesoamerica. Archaeological evidence of peyote use dates back to over 5000 years. Several chroniclers, mainly Fray Bernardino de Sahagun, described their effects in the sixteenth century. Conclusions: The use of psychoactive substances was common in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican societies. Today, local shamans and healers still use them in ritual ceremonies in Mesoamerica.Copyright © 2011 Sociedad Espanola de Neurologia.

N2  - After a 40-year hiatus there is now a revisiting of psychedelic drug therapy throughout psychiatry, with studies examining the drugs psilocybin, ketamine, ibogaine and ayahuasca in the treatment of drug dependence. Limitations to these therapies are both clinical and legal, but the possibility of improving outcomes for patients with substance dependency imposes an obligation to research this area.

T1  - Legal highs: staying on top of the flood of novel psychoactive substances
A1  - Baumeister D.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - There has been growing clinical, public, and media awareness and concern about the availability and potential harmfulness of so-called 'legal highs', which are more appropriately called new or novel psychoactive substances (NPS). A cat-and-mouse process has emerged wherein unknown chemists and laboratories are producing new, and as yet nonproscribed, compounds for human consumption; and as soon as they are banned, which they inevitably are, slightly modified analogues are produced to circumvent new laws. This rapidly changing environment, 81 new substances were identified in 2013 alone, has led to confusion for clinicians, psychopharmacologists, and the public at large. Our difficulties in keeping up with the process has had a two-fold negative effect: the danger of ignoring what is confusing; and the problem that some of the newer synthesized compounds appear ever more potent. This review aims to circumscribe a quick moving and growing field, and to categorize NPS into five major groups based upon their 'parent' compounds: stimulants similar to cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy; cannabinoids; benzodiazepine based drugs; dissociatives similar to ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP); and those modelled after classic hallucinogens such as LSD and psilocybin. Pharmacodynamic actions, subjective and physical effects, harmfulness, risk of dependency and, where appropriate, putative clinical potentials are described for each class. Clinicians might encounter NPS in various ways: anecdotal reportage; acute intoxication; as part of a substance misuse profile; and as a precipitant or perpetuating factor for longer-term physical and psychological ill health. Current data are overall limited, and much of our knowledge and treatment strategies are based upon those of the 'parent' compound. There is a critical need for more research in this field, and for professionals to make themselves more aware of this growing issue and how it might affect those we see clinically and try to help: a brave new world of so-called 'psychonauts' consuming NPS will also need informed 'psychotherapeutonauts'. The paper should serve as a primer for clinicians and interested readers, as well as provide a framework into which to place the new substances that will inevitably be synthesized in the future.Copyright © The Author(s), 2015.

T1  - Novel Psychoactive Substance and Other Drug Use by Young Adults in Western Australia

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Abstract: There is a lack of information regarding the use of novel psychoactive substances (NPS) in Western Australia. The aim of this study was to pilot-test an online survey to obtain data on the prevalence of NPS and other drug use by young Western Australians aged between 18 and 35 years. The Young Adult Drug and Alcohol Survey (YADAS) was a questionnaire deployed online for a period of six months. Participants were recruited via a combined targeted sampling and snowball methodology. There were 472 valid responses. Overall lifetime use of NPS was relatively high (17.6%), while use in the last year was lower (6.6%). These proportions were comparable to that of cocaine use. The most popular NPS were the synthetic cannabinoids. The proportions of respondents drinking alcohol at risky levels, mixing alcohol with energy drinks, and using pharmaceuticals such as ADHD medications for non-medical reasons were high. The YADAS is the first survey to ascertain the prevalence of use of numerous types of NPS in a large sample of young Western Australian adults. The utilization of an online survey methodology yielded valid results as compared to more intensive surveys, and enables researchers greater flexibility in being able to capture current trends.© 2015, Copyright © 2015 Crown Copyright.

N2  - To eat unidentified or misidentified mushrooms taken from the wild can be very dangerous. In the vast majority of toxic mushroom ingestions in Korea, the mushroom was incorrectly identified. In general, poisoning of toxic mushrooms can be classified into seven types according to the toxins that they contain; amatoxin, gyromitrin, coprine, muscarine, ibotenic acid-muscimol, psilocybin-psilocin and gastrointestinal irritants. When clinicians care for a patient who ingested a toxic mushroom, it is very important to identify what kind of mushroom may have caused a patient's illness. But, in clinical practice, accurate botanical identification of the mushroom can be very difficult. Therefore, for estimating the caused mushroom and adequate treatment of poisoning, clinicians should know the type and treatment of toxic mushroom poisoning.

T1  - Therese Lemperiere: Her works on psychotropic and current perspectives
T3  - Therese Lemperiere: Ses travaux sur les psychotropes et perspectives actuelles
A1  - Krebs M.-O. 
Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Objectives: This paper is a tribute to Therese Lemperiere's legacy regarding the study of psychotropic substances and an analysis of the lessons from her work for the future of psychopharmacology. Materials and methods: All her historical papers, mainly published in French journals, were reviewed as well as the summary of "titles and works" written by her. Rather than a comprehensive review, we have selected some papers in order to cover the various domains she addressed and to highlight some main characteristics of her work and envision. The paper also analyze her work in the context of the remarkable progresses of psychopharmacology in the second part of the 20th century as well as new perspectives for future innovations. Results: Therese Lemperiere started studying psychotropic drugs in 1953, in the department where the antipsychotic effects of chlorpromazine were discovered. In the same line as these pioneering observations, her work widely covers the study of various compounds, with a specific interest for clinical descriptions of therapeutic effects in patients of new drugs as well as induction of symptoms by substance of abuse in patients or healthy volunteers. She explored every classes of the classification proposed by J. Delay in 1957 (adopted by the 1961 World Congress of Psychiatry) i.e. psycholeptics including neuroleptics and mood stabilizers, psychoanaleptics such as nooanaleptics (amphetamine) and thymoanaleptics (antidepressants) and psychodysleptics especially psilocybine. Regarding amphetamine, T. Lemperiere discussed the differential diagnosis between pharmacopsychose and what she called 'amphetaminic pseudopsychosis' when psychosis persist after withdrawal and proposed that amphetamine reveals previously quiescent predisposition to schizophrenia. She underlined the bidirectional relation: amphetamine induces psychosis but also amphetamine as a self-medication for early dysfunction of schizophrenia. A picture very similar to current view on cannabis precipitated psychosis or self-medication by cocaine. T. Lemperiere studied several classes of antidepressant from the early tricyclic to very recent ones. In the 'two-year of experience with imipramine' article, she reviewed the best indications and factors of good response (melancholia, simple depression, women) while imipramine has low efficacy in severe melancholia and hypochondria. She proposed the association of imipramine to reduce the number of ECT and indicate some efficacy in OCD. The descriptions of psilocybine in healthy volunteers and patients are full of information regarding the individual variability and the semiology of psychotic-like experiences induced by psilocybine (illusions, "hallucinose", pseudohallucinations rather than hallucinations). Of course, Therese Lemperiere's explored the neuroleptics, many of them, with a special focus to analyze the differential therapeutic profile of each molecule, in order to improve the adequacy to the patient's profile. A main contribution was the study of reserpine, starting in 1954, that, together with the observation with chlorpromazine, contributed to the definition the of neuroleptics' class. These included the presence of extra pyramidal signs, which Therese Lemperiere also explored, including tardive dyskinesia. She rapidly recommended to prescribe neuroleptic at the minimal efficient dose and to avoid systematic prescription of anticholinergic drug. Therese Lemperiere promoted the use of long acting neuroleptics early in the disease, since they prevent treatment interruption and facilitate the alliance. Regarding the mood stabilizers, Therese Lemperiere contributed to the introduction of valpromide and valproate in psychiatry. Conclusions: Therese Lemperiere is a pioneer woman in French Psychiatry, and her legacy is not restricted to the field of psychopharmacology. Her remarkable contribution is mainly due to her clinical vision and analysis. The overview of the Therese Lemperiere's contribution to psychopharmacology underline several features of the early history of psychopharmacology: the origin of psychotropic drugs out of neurosciences (antibacterial, antiparasitic, antihypertensive, etc.), the close relation between clinician and chemists from pharmaceutical company, rapid transfer to the clinic and rapid feedback to the pharmaceutical companies, the fine clinical (phenotypic) descriptions, the use of psychotropic drugs to dissect psychiatric syndromes. These are invaluable lessons to apply for the future developments of psychopharmacology. They plead for a reinforcement of translational psychiatry with always more bidirectional relations between clinics and basic sciences and advocate for reopening the borders between psychiatry and other medical disciplines.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

T1  - Restructuring consciousness -The psychedelic state in light of integrated information theory
A1  - Gallimore A.R. 
Y1  - 2015//
N2  - The psychological state elicited by the classic psychedelics drugs, such as LSD and psilocybin, is one of the most fascinating and yet least understood states of consciousness. However, with the advent of modern functional neuroimaging techniques, the effect of these drugs on neural activity is now being revealed, although many of the varied phenomenological features of the psychedelic state remain challenging to explain. Integrated information theory (IIT) is one of the foremost contemporary theories of consciousness, providing a mathematical formalization of both the quantity and quality of conscious experience. This theory can be applied to all known states of consciousness, including the psychedelic state. Using the results of functional neuroimaging data on the psychedelic state, the effects of psychedelic drugs on both the level and structure of consciousness can be explained in terms of the conceptual framework of IIT. This new IIT-based model of the psychedelic state provides an explanation for many of its phenomenological features, including unconstrained cognition, alterations in the structure and meaning of concepts and a sense of expanded awareness. This model also suggests that whilst cognitive flexibility, creativity, and imagination are enhanced during the psychedelic state, this occurs at the expense of cause-effect information, as well as degrading the brain's ability to organize, categorize, and differentiate the constituents of conscious experience. Furthermore, the model generates specific predictions that can be tested using a combination of functional imaging techniques, as has been applied to the study of levels of consciousness during anesthesia and following brain injury.Copyright © 2015 Gallimore.

N2  - A 19-year-old male suffered orthopedic fractures, blunt solid organ injury and pneumopericardium after a fall from 40 feet. With the exception of an external fixation device, he was managed non-operatively and discharged to a rehabilitation unit after 8 days. He was readmitted 4 days later with chest pain and clinical evidence of pericardititis that resolved with the initiation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine. He returned to the rehabilitation hospital, but was readmitted once again for chest pain and hypotension. Echocardiogram revealed cardiac tamponade that required emergent drainage. He tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home from the hospital to continue treatment for his pericarditis. He is doing well at 3 months of follow-up.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Schizophrenia is a complex mental health disorder with positive, negative and cognitive symptom domains. Approximately one third of patients are resistant to currently available medication. New therapeutic targets and a better understanding of the basic biological processes that drive pathogenesis are needed in order to develop therapies that will improve quality of life for these patients. Several drugs that act on neurotransmitter systems in the brain have been suggested to model aspects of schizophrenia in animals and in man. In this paper, we selectively review findings from dopaminergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic, cannabinoid, GABA, cholinergic and kappa opioid pharmacological drug models to evaluate their similarity to schizophrenia. Understanding the interactions between these different neurotransmitter systems and their relationship with symptoms will be an important step towards building a coherent hypothesis for the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.Copyright © The Author(s), 2014.

N2  - Abstract The development of pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) has presented the opportunity for investigation of the neurophysiological effects of drugs in vivo. Psilocin, a hallucinogen metabolised from psilocybin, was recently reported to evoke brain region-specific, phMRI signal changes in humans. The present study investigated the effects of psilocin in a rat model using phMRI and then probed the relationship between neuronal and haemodynamic responses using a multimodal measurement preparation. Psilocin (2 mg/kg or 0.03 mg/kg i.v.) or vehicle was administered to rats (N = 6/group) during either phMRI scanning or concurrent imaging of cortical blood flow and recording of local field potentials. Compared to vehicle controls psilocin (2 mg/kg) evoked phMRI signal increases in a number of regions including olfactory and limbic areas and elements of the visual system. PhMRI signal decreases were seen in other regions including somatosensory and motor cortices. Investigation of neurovascular coupling revealed that whilst neuronal responses (local field potentials) to sensory stimuli were decreased in amplitude by psilocin administration, concurrently measured haemodynamic responses (cerebral blood flow) were enhanced. The present findings show that psilocin evoked region-specific changes in phMRI signals in the rat, confirming recent human data. However, the results also suggest that the haemodynamic signal changes underlying phMRI responses reflect changes in both neuronal activity and neurovascular coupling. This highlights the importance of understanding the neurovascular effects of pharmacological manipulations for interpreting haemodynamic neuroimaging data.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

T1  - Treatment-refractory obsessive compulsive disorder
A1  - Atmaca M. 
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and debilitating disorder. As can be seen in other psychiatric disorders, refractoriness to treatment is an important problem for patients with OCD. OCD is a chronic disorder like collagen tissue disorders, with symptoms tending to wax and wane but rarely remitting spontaneously through the course of the disorder. An important part of OCD patients respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone or in combination with other medications, and cognitive behavior therapy. However, up to 30%-40% of patients do not respond to the available treatment modalities. The present paper tried to review the current state of knowledge on definition, clinical aspects, etiopathogenesis, and treatment strategies of patients with refractory OCD.Copyright © 2016

N2  - Ego-disturbances have been a topic in schizophrenia research since the earliest clinical descriptions of the disorder. Manifesting as a feeling that one's "self," "ego," or "I" is disintegrating or that the border between one's self and the external world is dissolving, "ego-disintegration" or "dissolution" is also an important feature of the psychedelic experience, such as is produced by psilocybin (a compound found in "magic mushrooms"). Fifteen healthy subjects took part in this placebo-controlled study. Twelve-minute functional MRI scans were acquired on two occasions: subjects received an intravenous infusion of saline on one occasion (placebo) and 2 mg psilocybin on the other. Twenty-two visual analogue scale ratings were completed soon after scanning and the first principal component of these, dominated by items referring to "ego-dissolution", was used as a primary measure of interest in subsequent analyses. Employing methods of connectivity analysis and graph theory, an association was found between psilocybin-induced ego-dissolution and decreased functional connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and high-level cortical regions. Ego-dissolution was also associated with a "disintegration" of the salience network and reduced interhemispheric communication. Addressing baseline brain dynamics as a predictor of drug-response, individuals with lower diversity of executive network nodes were more likely to experience ego-dissolution under psilocybin. These results implicate MTL-cortical decoupling, decreased salience network integrity, and reduced inter-hemispheric communication in psilocybin-induced ego disturbance and suggest that the maintenance of "self"or "ego," as a perceptual phenomenon, may rest on the normal functioning of these systems.

N2  - The pharmacological activities and acute toxicity of the psilocin (PC) and dried residues of the crude extracts of psychotropic mushrooms were investigated in mice. The hallucinogenic substances were effectively isolated, by using methanol, from the species of Psilocybe semilanceata and Pholiotina cyanopus, that were collected in the north-east region of Poland. The chemical analysis of these extracts, which was performed by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS), indicated the presence of psilocin and other hallucinogenic substances, including indolealkylamines and their phosphorylated analogues. When the pure psilocin or fungal extracts were used, slight differences in determined LD50 values were observed. However, the application of PC evoked the highest level of toxicity (293.07 mg/kg) compared to the activity of extracts from Ph. cyanopus and P. semilanceata, where the level of LD50 was 316.87 mg/kg and 324.37 mg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, the behavioral test, which considered the head-twitching response (HTR), was used to assess the effects of the studied psychotropic factors on the serotonergic system. Both, the fungal extracts and psilocin evoked characteristic serotoninergic effects depending on the dose administered to mice, acting as an agonist/partial agonist on the serotonergic system. A dose of 200 mg/kg 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) induced spontaneous head-twitching in mice (100% effect), as a result of the formation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the brain. Compared to the activity of 5-HTP, the intraperitoneal administration of 1mg/kg of psilocin or hallucinogenic extracts of studied mushrooms (Ph. cyanopus and P. semilanceata) reduced the number of head-twitch responses of about 46% and 30%, respectively. In contrast, the administration of PC exhibited a reduction of about 60% in HTR numbers.Copyright © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - In the area of psychotropic drugs, tryptamines are known to be a broad class of classical or serotonergic hallucinogens. These drugs are capable of producing profound changes in sensory perception, mood and thought in humans and act primarily as agonists of the 5-HT2A receptor. Well-known tryptamines such as psilocybin contained in Aztec sacred mushrooms and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), present in South American psychoactive beverage ayahuasca, have been restrictedly used since ancient times in sociocultural and ritual contexts. However, with the discovery of hallucinogenic properties of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in mid-1900s, tryptamines began to be used recreationally among young people. More recently, new synthetically produced tryptamine hallucinogens, such as alpha-methyltryptamine (AMT), 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) and 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-DIPT), emerged in the recreational drug market, which have been claimed as the next-generation designer drugs to replace LSD ('legal' alternatives to LSD). Tryptamine derivatives are widely accessible over the Internet through companies selling them as 'research chemicals', but can also be sold in 'headshops' and street dealers. Reports of intoxication and deaths related to the use of new tryptamines have been described over the last years, raising international concern over tryptamines. However, the lack of literature pertaining to pharmacological and toxicological properties of new tryptamine hallucinogens hampers the assessment of their actual potential harm to general public health. This review provides a comprehensive update on tryptamine hallucinogens, concerning their historical background, prevalence, patterns of use and legal status, chemistry, toxicokinetics, toxicodynamics and their physiological and toxicological effects on animals and humans.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Background Ibogaine is a naturally occurring hallucinogen with postulated anti-addictive qualities. While illegal domestically, a growing number of individuals have sought it out for treatment of opiate dependence, primarily in poorly regulated overseas clinics. Existing serious adverse events include cardiac and vestibular toxicity, though ours is the first report of mania stemming from its use. Objectives To report on a case series of psychiatric emergency room patients whose unregulated use of ibogaine resulted in mania in three patients with no prior diagnosis of bipolar illness. Methods Review and summarize charts of three cases. Relevant literature was also reviewed for discussion. Results Two cases of reported ibogaine ingestion for self-treatment of addictions, and one for psycho-spiritual experimentation resulted in symptoms consistent with mania. No prior reports of mania were found in the literature, and the literature suggests growing popularity of ibogaine's use. Conclusions The three cases presented demonstrate a temporal association between ibogaine ingestion and subsequent development of mania. Scientific Significance In light of these cases, clinicians faced with a new onset mania may benefit from careful substance use and treatment history, specifically regarding opiates. In the vulnerable and often desperate addiction population, in particular, the number of patients seeking this treatment appears to be growing. We advise clinicians to be prepared for discussing the safety, efficacy, and paucity of good data regarding ibogaine with patients who may be considering its use.

T1  - Recent advances in the neuropsychopharmacology of serotonergic hallucinogens
A1  - Halberstadt A.L. 
Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Serotonergic hallucinogens, such as (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and mescaline, are somewhat enigmatic substances. Although these drugs are derived from multiple chemical families, they all produce remarkably similar effects in animals and humans, and they show cross-tolerance. This article reviews the evidence demonstrating the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is the primary site of hallucinogen action. The 5-HT2A receptor is responsible for mediating the effects of hallucinogens in human subjects, as well as in animal behavioral paradigms such as drug discrimination, head twitch response, prepulse inhibition of startle, exploratory behavior, and interval timing. Many recent clinical trials have yielded important new findings regarding the psychopharmacology of these substances. Furthermore, the use of modern imaging and electrophysiological techniques is beginning to help unravel how hallucinogens work in the brain. Evidence is also emerging that hallucinogens may possess therapeutic efficacy.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The experiences induced by psychedelics share a wide variety of subjective features, related to the complex changes in perception and cognition induced by this class of drugs. A remarkable increase in introspection is at the core of these altered states of consciousness. Self-oriented mental activity has been consistently linked to the Default Mode Network (DMN), a set of brain regionsmore active during rest than during the execution of a goal-directed task. Here we used fMRI technique to inspect the DMN during the psychedelic state induced by Ayahuasca in ten experienced subjects. Ayahuasca is a potion traditionally used by Amazonian Amerindians composed by a mixture of compounds that increase monoaminergic transmission. In particular, we examined whether Ayahuasca changes the activity and connectivity of the DMN and the connection between the DMN and the task-positive network (TPN). Ayahuasca caused a significant decrease in activity throughmost parts of the DMN, including its most consistent hubs: the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)/Precuneus and the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC). Functional connectivity within the PCC/Precuneus decreased after Ayahuasca intake. No significant change was observed in the DMN-TPN orthogonality. Altogether, our results support the notion that the altered state of consciousness induced by Ayahuasca, like those induced by psilocybin (another serotonergic psychedelic), meditation and sleep, is linked to the modulation of the activity and the connectivity of the DMN.Copyright © 2015 Palhano-Fontes et al.

T1  - Validation of the revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire in experimental sessions with psilocybin

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - The 30-item revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30) was previously developed within an online survey of mystical-type experiences occasioned by psilocybin-containing mushrooms. The rated experiences occurred on average eight years before completion of the questionnaire. The current paper validates the MEQ30 using data from experimental studies with controlled doses of psilocybin. Data were pooled and analyzed from five laboratory experiments in which participants (n=184) received a moderate to high oral dose of psilocybin (at least 20 mg/70 kg). Results of confirmatory factor analysis demonstrate the reliability and internal validity of the MEQ30. Structural equation models demonstrate the external and convergent validity of the MEQ30 by showing that latent variable scores on the MEQ30 positively predict persisting change in attitudes, behavior, and well-being attributed to experiences with psilocybin while controlling for the contribution of the participant-rated intensity of drug effects. These findings support the use of the MEQ30 as an efficient measure of individual mystical experiences. A method to score a "complete mystical experience" that was used in previous versions of the mystical experience questionnaire is validated in the MEQ30, and a stand-alone version of the MEQ30 is provided for use in future research.Copyright © British Association for Psychopharmacology.

T1  - Light microscopy can reveal the consumption of a mixture of psychotropic plant and fungal material in suspicious death

N2  - Abstract Light microscopical examination of plant and fungal remains in the post mortem gut may be capable of demonstrating the ingestion of unexpected natural psychotropic materials. This is demonstrated here in a case in which a 'shaman' was accused of causing the death of a young man. The deceased had participated in a ceremony which involved the drinking of ayahuasca in order to induce a psychotropic experience. Ayahuasca is an infusion of Banisteriopsis caapi (ayahuasca vine), which produces a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and one or more additional tropical plants, generally Psychotria viridis (chacruna) which produces dimethyltryptamine (DMT). The monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents DMT from being broken down in the gut, so enabling its passage into the bloodstream and across the blood/brain barrier. Toxicological tests for DMT demonstrated the presence of this compound in the body. The deceased was reported to be in the habit of using Psilocybe semilanceata (liberty cap). This fungus (popularly called magic mushroom) contains psilocybin which is hydrolysed in the gut to psilocin; this compound mimics a serotonin uptake inhibitor, and also invokes psychotropic experiences. Microscopical examination established that the ileum and colon contained spores of Psilocybe and, in addition, pollen of Cannabis sativa and seeds of Papaver cf. somniferum (opium poppy). Both the plant species yield psychotropic substances. Palynological and mycological analysis of containers from the deceased person's dwelling also yielded abundant trace evidence of pertinent pollen and spores. The police had requested analysis for DMT but there was no screening for other psychotropic substances. Investigators were surprised that a mixture of hallucinogenic materials had been consumed by the deceased. The charge was modified from manslaughter to possession of a Class A' drug as the deceased had been consuming psychotropic substances not administered by the 'shaman'. Where death involving drugs from plants or fungi is suspected, microscopical examination of samples from the gut can provide a rapid and effective method for assessing, in a temporal context, the presence of ingested materials that may not have been previously suspected. The example presented here also demonstrates the need for caution in interpreting toxicological results where screening for unusual compounds has been limited.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

N2  - The United Nations drug control conventions of 1960 and 1971 and later additions have inadvertently resulted in perhaps the greatest restrictions of medical and life sciences research. These conventions now need to be revised to allow neuroscience to progress unimpeded and to assist in the innovation of treatments for brain disorders. In the meantime, local changes, such as the United Kingdom moving cannabis from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2, should be implemented to allow medical research to develop appropriately.Copyright © 2015 David Nutt.

N2  - Therapeutic Case Report. Background: Since the discovery of LSD in 1938, reports of prolonged psychotic reactions associated with its use in patients with no psychiatric history have been reported. While LSD is the most studied hallucinogen, there are many other agents that have the ability to distort perception, thought, and mood in a similar manner. One example is psilocybin-containing mushrooms. Though the theoretical risk of adverse reactions is similar to LSD, few case reports describe treatment of prolonged psychotic-like symptoms following psilocybin ingestion. Patient Case: A 24-year-old male presented to the ER with acute psychosis one week after consuming "magic mushrooms" and marijuana. No laboratory confirmation for psilocybin was performed. His history included CNS malformations, migraine headaches, and ADHD. His social history was consistent for cannabis use. He had no documented psychiatric history and no medications, however he reported a positive family history of schizophrenia and family noted abnormal behavior leading up to the incident. In the ER he complained of a left retro-orbital headache that was relieved with clonazepam. The patient reported that he could hear a voice speaking to him, but denied any maleficent auditory hallucinations. The patient denied visual hallucinations but reported praying daily with an unobserved male. Physical examination and laboratory values were normal. During his psychiatric admission, he continued to exhibit signs of psychosis (paranoia and religious preoccupation). Olanzapine and lorazepam were initiated with minimal improvement and subsequently cross-tapered from olanzapine to risperidone. At discharge, the patient was no longer responsive to internal stimuli, exhibited decreased religious preoccupation, minimal paranoia, and was able to interact with peers. He was discharged on olanzapine 5 mg and risperidone 7 mg daily to complete the cross taper as an outpatient. Review of Literature: A PUBMED search revealed one case series involving two patients who consumed psilocybin-containing mushrooms with effective treatment with risperidone. Conclusion: While this patient case does not provide a causal link between psilocybin-containing mushrooms and the patient's prolonged psychosis, the drug may have precipitated a psychotic break or exacerbated undiagnosed schizophrenia. Risperidone appeared to be the most effective agent for symptom control, consistent with previously published case reports.

N2  - Aims: We assessed long-term (>12 months) outcomes of psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation, and qualitatively analyzed participants' accounts to inform potential psychological mechanisms of treatment efficacy. Methods: Fifteen individuals who completed a pilot study of psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation were invited for a longterm follow-up. Eleven (73%) returned and were interviewed about their current smoking and treatment experience (mean time since treatment = 30 months, SD = 17, range = 16-57). Exhaled carbon monoxide, and self-report measures of craving, temptation, and smoking abstinence self-efficacy were assessed. Results: At 6 months, 10 of 11 (91%) participants were smoking abstinent. At long-term follow-up, 9 of 11 (82%) were still abstinent. Craving and temptation were not significantly different between 6-month and long-term follow-ups, and remained significantly lower than at baseline. Smoking abstinence self-efficacy showed significant persisting increases from baseline scores, and remained comparable to those at 6 months. Participants reported profound, insightful psilocybin experiences and good rapport with study staff as factors impacting treatment efficacy. Conclusions: Psilocybin, administered under controlled conditions in a treatment context, is associated with ongoing smoking abstinence and persisting reductions in craving and temptation. Results were potentially related to personally meaningful experiences and rapport with study staff. Results showed lasting benefits in this sample consistent with prior research on long-term effects of psilocybin.

N2  - Aims: This study sought to compare questionnaire ratings of subjective experiences after psilocybin when administered in controlled research settings vs. uncontrolled, non-research settings. Methods: Two internet-based surveys were conducted in reference to participants' single most mystical/spiritual/meaningful experience (ME; n = 1602) or to their single most psychologically difficult/challenging experience (CE; n = 1993) after ingesting psilocybin mushrooms. Data from these surveys were compared to data from 3 laboratory studies conducted in healthy volunteers (LS; n = 110-126) who received a high dose of psilocybin (30 mg/70 kg). Data were the percent of participants endorsing various questionnaire items. Results: The CE group was more likely to endorse negative feelings such as fear (81% of participants), isolation (69%), physical distress (57%), and insanity (64%) than the ME or LS groups (range 21-30%). The ME and LS groups, respectively, were more likely to endorse positive and spiritual feelings of peace (88, 86%), awe (93, 90%), joy (91, 90%), spiritual height (76, 77%), and "All is One" (75, 70%) than the CE group (range 43-64%). ME and LS groups, respectively, also were more likely to endorse that the experience was among the 5 most spiritually significant of their lives (62, 67%) and that it increased well-being/life satisfaction (94, 94%) than those in the CE group (31% for spiritually significant; 76% for well-being). Conclusions: The phenomenology of psilocybin experiences in the LS group was more similar to that in the ME group than the CE group, suggesting that laboratory procedures are effective at minimizing negative experiences and maximizing positive experiences.

N2  - Aims: The Mystical Experiences Questionnaire (MEQ) was previously developed to evaluate discrete mystical-type experiences occasioned by the classic hallucinogen psilocybin. The 30-item revised MEQ (MEQ30) was previously psychometrically validated through factor analysis of retrospective accounts of profound experiences with psilocybin-containing mushrooms. We psychometrically validated the MEQ30 using data from experimental laboratory studies with controlled doses of psilocybin. Methods: We applied confirmatory factor analysis to MEQ30 responses provided immediately after moderate/high oral psilocybin dose (>=20 mg/70 kg) sessions (n = 184) from five laboratory experiments. We used structural equation modeling to regress MEQ30 factor scores on the rated intensity of drug effects and ratings provided 3-8 weeks post-session of persisting effects attributed to the moderate to high dose psilocybin session. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses support the reliability and internal validity of the MEQ30. Structural equation models demonstrate the external and convergent validity of the MEQ30 by showing that latent variable scores on the MEQ30 positively predict persisting change in attitudes, behavior, and well-being attributed to experiences with psilocybin while controlling for the contribution of the participant-rated intensity of drug effects. Conclusions: Validation of the MEQ30 in experimental data constitutes an important step in developing this questionnaire instrument for use in pharmacological studies of mysticaltype experiences. Further experimental work should validate the MEQ30 in studies of mystical-type experiences encountered through other means. On the basis of our findings, we recommend use of the MEQ30 for future investigations of individual episodes of mystical-type experiences.

N2  - Introduction: New psychoactive substances (NPS) refer to emerging substances that have appeared on the market and are not under international control [1]. NPS have experienced an unprecedented increase in number, type and availability [2]. O-Acetylpsilocin also known as Psilacetin and 4-Acetoxy-DMT (4-AcO-DMT) is a synthetic tryptamine having a psychedelic effect by stimulating the serotoninergic system [4] and proposed as a research substitute for psilocybin as a prodrug of psilocin [3]. Even though patented in 1963 its effects on humans have not been systematically studied and it is non-regulated in Spain. Search for literature on 4-AcO-DMT in March 2015 found no studies conducted on humans. Objective: The aims of this study are (1) to explore the presence of 4-AcO-DMT from the samples handled to and analyzed by harm reduction service Energy Control and (2) to evaluate the rate between 4-AcO-DMT and other related tryptamines (mushrooms, 4-AcO-DIPT, 4-AcO-MIPT and psilocybin). Materials and Methods: All samples analyzed from January 2009 to December 2014 handled as 4-AcO-DMT or in which 4-AcO-DMT was found were studied. Spanish harm-reduction non-governmental organization Energy Control offers users the possibility of analyzing the substances they intend to consume. Analysis were done by Thin Layer Chromatography and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Results: From 17.432 samples registered during the period of study 4-AcO-DMT was found in 48 (0.27%): 46 presented as 4-AcO-DMT, 1 as 4-OH-DMT (psilocin) and 1 as an unknown substance. Totally 48 samples were presented as 4-AcO-DMT: apart from the aforementioned 46 samples another 2 samples were presented as 4-AcO-DMT were no substance was found. In 37 samples containing 4-AcO-DMT (77.08%) presence of 4-OH-DMT was also found. From 2009 to 2010 9 samples were delivered as 4-AcO-DMT, 16 from 2011 to 2012 and 23 from 2013 to 2014 4-AcO-DMT was the 24th most handled substance during the whole period and representing 62.33% (48 out of 77) of the psilocin related substances [4-AcO-DMT (n = 48), mushrooms (n = 12), 4-AcO-DIPT (n = 12), 4-AcO-MIPT (n = 1) and psilocybin (n = 1)]. Conclusion and Discussion: Results show a recent increase in 4-Aco-DMT analysis that could translate a progressive rise in its recreational use gaining ground to other regulated tryptamines. Whether psilocin found on samples is a result of adulteration, degradation or an analytical artefact should be further studied. Clinical relevance comes from its growing use and the absence of scientific evidence on humans, not even a case report, therefore relying on users subjective experience to predict the effects of the substance. Awareness should be raised to clinicians and scientist in order to promote evidence on this substance clinical effects as well as epidemiological data at a larger scale.

N2  - Social cognition is a crucial factor influencing development, progress, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. Impairments in social cognition represent central characteristics of various psychiatric and neurological disorders and are leading causes of disability and comprise real-world functioning, such as work functioning and independent living. However, social cognition skills are insufficiently targeted by current treatment approaches. In particular, patients suffering from depression show an increased negative reaction to social exclusion and deficits in empathy. Psilocybin is a preferential 5-HT2A (Ki = 6 nM) and 5-HT1A receptor (Ki = 190 nM) agonist and has previously been shown to reduce the neural response to negative emotional stimuli [1]. However, it is not known if this extends to negative social interaction and whether 5-HT2A/1A receptor stimulation induces changes in empathy. Given the clear need for improved treatment of sociocognitive functioning in psychiatric disorders, it is important to better understand the neuronal and neuromodulatory substrates of social cognition, in particular the specific role of the 5-HT2A/1A receptor system [2]. In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design we therefore investigated the neural and behavioral response to ostracism after the acute administration of psilocybin (0.215 mg/kg) and placebo in 21 healthy volunteers using an interactive virtual ball-tossing game called "Cyberball" [3]. Participants completed social inclusion and exclusion (participant was ostracized by the other two players) conditions while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Furthermore, participants rated their feeling of social exclusion on a 9-point scale. Moreover, cognitive and emotional empathy were assessed using the Multifaceted Empathy Test [4]. Behavioral data were analyzed by repeatedmeasures analyses of variance with treatment (psilocybin vs. placebo) as within-subject factor or paired t-test where applicable. FMRI images were analyzed according to an event-related design using a general linear model (GLM) as implemented in SPM8. The neural response to social exclusion vs. inclusion was reduced after psilocybin administration compared to placebo in the right dACC - A brain region associated with "social pain" (peak: x = 6, y = 26, z = 22, p<0.05, FWE). In line with these results, subjective ratings assessing the feeling of social exclusion during the game revealed that participants felt less excluded after treatment with psilocybin compared with placebo (T(20)=2.71, p<0.01), while attention and awareness of exclusion were not altered (all p>0.1). Furthermore, emotional empathy was enhanced after treatment with psilocybin (F(1,31) = 7.09, p <0.01), while no significant differences were found for cognitive empathy (F(1.31) = 1.28, p>0.27). These results show that the 5-HT2A/1A receptor subtypes play an important role in the modulation of socio-cognitive functioning and therefore may be relevant for the treatment of disturbances in social cognition in psychiatric disorders. In particular, they may be important for the normalization of empathy deficits and increased negative reaction to social exclusion in patients with major depression disorder. Understanding the neuronal and neuromodulatory substrates of social cognition offers the potential to contribute to a mechanistic understanding of social interaction and therefore identify novel targets for pharmacological interventions in psychiatric disorders.

N2  - Background: Our research team have conducted a series of MRI and MEG studies with the 5HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin in comparison with MDMA, an entactogen that releases 5HT. The MRI studies of psilocybin (both ASL and fMRI) revealed unexpected reduction in brain blood flow and a decrease in BOLD signal (Carhart-Harris et al 2013 PNAS) in high-level cortical regions and the thalamus, with post-hoc analysis showing large increases in brain connectivity between, rather than within, the usual resting state networks (Petri et al J Roy Soc 2014). The cortical psilocybin MRI findings were confirmed by a later MEG study that revealed a major loss of power in all measured frequency bands (1-100Hz) after psilocybin with decreases in alpha power in the posterior cingulate cortex correlating with egodissolution measures (Carhart-Harris and Muthukumaraswamy et al 2013 J Neurosci). Results from the fMRI and MEG work suggested psilocybin has antidepressant properties and from these we are now conducting the first study of psilocybin in resistant depression. Data from a pilot phase will be ready for the ACNP meeting. MDMA also decreased blood flow and BOLD signal but the effects were largely subcortical, particularly in the amygdala, and no psychedelic effects were seen (Carhart-Harris et al 2014 Biol Psych). Negative memories were attenuated and positive ones enhanced by MDMA and these effects were associated with fMRI-measured changes in brain activity (Carhart-Harris et al 2013 Int Neuropychopharm). LSD is the prototypical hallucinogen, with much greater use than the others in psychiatric and research settings, with over 1000 papers published before it was banned in 1967. Since then, and only in the past year, there have been 3 research reports, but none using modern brain imaging methods. Methods: Over the course of 6 hours, 20 healthy volunteers were scanned sequentially with ASL/BOLD-fMRI/ and MEG following 75 microgm LSD iv or saline placebo in a crossover design at least 2 weeks apart. Subjective ratings of psychedelic experiences were then correlated with the imaging data. Twelve patients with resistant depression were treated with two sessions of psilocybin. Significant improvements in symptom severity were observed for up to 5 weeks post-treatment, with a far greater before and (1 week) after treatment effect size (Cohen's d = 3.4) than seen with currently available anti-depressant interventions. Results: LSD decreased integrity and segregation of brain networks and this effect correlated with subjective ratings of changes in consciousness, including ego-dissolution. Increased functional connectivity between the visual cortex and high-level cortical regions correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations. Patients treated with psilocybin for resistant depression have shown marked improvements in the symptom severity post-treatment. Conclusions: The LSD data and our three prior psilocybin studies show that 5HT2A agonist hallucinogens provoke profound changes in consciousness due to decreased integrity of brain networks and a decrease in betweennetwork segregation found in resting state measures, leading to a more chaotic or "entropic" brain state. These effects may also explain the utility of these drugs in addiction and mood disorders. The psilocybin for depression findings suggest that psilocybin is a safe and effective treatment for severe depression.

T1  - A single dose of psilocybin produces substantial and enduring decreases in anxiety and depression in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis: A randomized double-blind trial

N2  - Background: Patients with cancer often develop chronic, clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression that have a significant negative impact on the quality of their life. Existing pharmacological and psychological treatments are very limited. Several trials in the 1960s and 1970s with the classic hallucinogens LSD and DPT in cancer patients showed clinically significant improvement in ratings of depression and anxiety. These trials involved 236 cancer patients. Recently, Grob and colleagues (2011) reported a pilot study with a moderate dose of the classic hallucinogen psilocybin (about 14 mg/70 kg) showing decreases in anxiety and depression in 12 cancer patients. Methods: The study used a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design to investigate the acute and sustained effects of a very low psilocybin dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a moderate-high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg). Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. 51 patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis who had symptoms of anxiety or depression received a low or high dose of psilocybin in counterbalanced order with about 5 weeks between sessions and a final follow up at 6 months. For this preliminary analysis, results between the low (n=25) and high (n=26) dose groups on the first session were compared. Enduring effects were assessed at a 6 month follow-up. Results: On session days, the high dose group showed substantially greater effects including perceptual changes, mystical-type subjective experiences, and labile mood. At the 5-week follow-up the high dose group showed significantly lower anxiety (STAI Trait Anxiety, HAM-A) and depression (BDI, HAM-D) compared to the low dose group (effect size mean and range 0.98, 0.60-1.30). The participants attributed significantly greater positive changes in attitudes about life/self, positive social effects, and positive behavior changes to the experience, and a higher percentage reported the experience to be among the 5 most personally meaningful of their lives (54% vs. 16%). Total mystical experience scores at the end of the session showed significant negative correlations with the above measures of anxiety and depression at 5 weeks. Partial correlation analysis showed this relationship remained significant after controlling for ratings of intensity of drug effect. The decreases in anxiety and depression were sustained at 6 month follow-up. Conclusions: A single moderate-high dose of psilocybin, when administered under supportive conditions to carefully screened and prepared participants, can produce substantial and enduring decreases in anxiety and depression in patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis.

T1  - Mood, craving, and self-efficacy in psilocybin-assisted treatment of alcoholism

N2  - Background: Evidence suggests that classic hallucinogens have clinically relevant effects in alcohol and drug addiction. It is hypothesized that acute pharmacological and psychological effects trigger longer-term changes in psychological variables such as mood, craving, and selfefficacy, and that these changes in turn lead to persisting improvement in substance use behavior. This report explores the effects of psilocybin administration on changes in mood, alcohol craving, and self-efficacy, and the relationship of these changes to short-term drinking outcomes that were previously reported. Methods: Ten patients with DSM-IV alcohol dependence received psilocybin 0.3 mg/kg PO in a supervised 8-hour session after 4 weeks of outpatient psychotherapy. Nine of these participants remained in the study for at least 4 additional weeks, during which no psilocybin was administered. Measures of acute medication effects included the total score from the Mystical Experience Scale, the General scale from the Altered States of Consciousness Scale (5D-ASC), and the Intensity subscale of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale. Measures of mood (the Profile of Mood States), self-efficacy (the Alcohol Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale, Confidence subscale), craving (the Penn. Alcohol Craving Scale), and drinking were obtained at baseline and at intervals during and following treatment. Drinking outcomes were percent drinking days and percent heavy drinking days. Results: Mean Profile of Mood States subscale scores did not change significantly in the week following psilocybin administration (week 5) relative to the week before (week 4). However, individual changes in tension, depression, vigor, and confusion were significantly (p <.05) correlated with one or more of the three measures of the subjective experience during the first psilocybin session (r =.680 t<920). In all cases, more favorable mood outcomes were observed in participants who had stronger subjective experiences. Changes in mood symptoms at week 5 were significantly correlated with changes in drinking during the month following the first psilocybin session (weeks 5-8) relative to the month before (weeks 1-4). Similarly, craving was not significantly decreased at week 5, but change in craving was strongly correlated (r4.8, p<.01) with two of three measures of subjective experience intensity, and this change in craving was correlated with subsequent changes drinking outcomes in weeks 5-8 (r 4.7, p <.05). Significant correlations were observed between change in craving and change in depression, vigor, fatigue, and confusion. An increase in self-efficacy was also observed at week 5, and this change too was significantly correlated (r 4.7, p <.05) with two of the three measures of subjective experience. However, change in self-efficacy was not significantly correlated with subsequent change in drinking, or with measures of mood and craving. Conclusions: In this proof-of concept trial, stronger experiences with psilocybin produced more positive change in mood, craving, and self-efficacy, and changes in mood and craving were in turn predictive of short-term improvement in drinking. Controlled trials are necessary to test whether the causal mechanisms suggested here can be reproduced prospectively.

N2  - Background: Mushrooms are notoriously difficult to positively identify, for amateurs and professionals alike. Delayedonset gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are concerning for potential amatoxin-induced hepatotoxicity, as seen with some Amanita, Lepiota, Conocybe, and Galerina species. We report a case of mushroom ingestion for recreational use, which was ultimately identified using DNA sequencing in collaboration with a mycologist. Case Report: A 17 year old male presented to the emergency department with delayed-onset abdominal pain five hours after ingesting 15 mushrooms for recreational use. A mycologist examined the dried sample and it was initially identified as a Galerina species. Given the absence of hallucinogenic symptoms in the patient, and the potential for delayed hepatotoxic effects, he was treated with multi-dose activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, and milk thistle. Nausea and vomiting persisted for several days, but hepatotoxicity did not occur. The mushroom sample was later positively identified by DNA sequence as Gymnopilus penetrans. Case Discussion: Gymnopilus and Galerina species have similar appearance and microscopy, making it difficult to differentiate the two. In this case, visual identification of the mushroom was complicated by the sample being poorly dried. Several Gymnopilus species contain psilocybin, although G. penetrans does not. It has a bitter taste and is considered inedible. There are no previous reports of this species causing delayed GI symptoms, the presence of which may confuse it with the much more toxic Galerina autumnalis. We assume this patient's persisting GI symptoms were side effects of the treatments provided. Conclusions: In patients with mushroom ingestions who develop delayed-onset GI symptoms, it is prudent to treat as soon as possible for possible amatoxin hepatotoxicity. Silibinin, acetylcysteine, and/or multi-dose activated charcoal may all be beneficial and are of relatively low risk. DNA sequencing of the material is uncommon, may take several weeks, and should not be relied upon to guide therapy. Poison center collaboration with a mycologist who is familiar with local species remains invaluable.

N2  - Background: Tryptamines are a class of indole alkaloid chemicals, many of which have hallucinogenic effects. The number of hallucinogenic tryptamine reports to a US forensic laboratories database increased greatly during 2006-2010. The objective of this study was to describe hallucinogenic tryptamine exposures reported to a statewide poison center system. Methods: Cases were hallucinogenic tryptamine exposures reported to a statewide poison center system during 2000-2014. Psilocybin and hallucinogenic mushroom exposures were excluded. Exposures involving other substances and those not followed to a final medical outcome were included. The distribution of exposures by various demographic and clinical factors was determined. Results: There were 52 total exposures, of which 27 involved N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 7 alpha-methyltryptamine (AMT), 5 4-acetoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (4-AcO-DMT), 5 N,N-dipropyltryptamine (DPT), 4 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-DIPT), 2 5-methoxy-a-methyltryptamine (5-MeO-aMT), 1 5-methoxy-N,N-diallyltryptamine (5-MeO-DALT), and 1 unknown. The annual number ranged from 0 to 8 with no clear trend. The mean patient age was 21 years (range 13-39 years); 77% were male. 81% of the exposures were due to intentional abuse or misuse, 8% suspected attempted suicide, 6% unintentional, and 6% unknown; 87% of the exposures occurred at the patient's own residence, 2% another residence, 2% public area, and 10% unknown location. The exposure route was 65% ingestion alone, 9% inhalation alone, 5% ingestion and inhalation, 4% rectal, and 18% unknown. 85% of the patients were already at/en route to a healthcare facility, 12% referred to a healthcare facility, and 4% managed on site. The medical outcome was 2% no effect, 12% minor effect, 65% moderate effect, 8% major effect, 6% not followed-minimal effects, and 8% unable to follow-potentially toxic. The most common adverse effects were tachycardia (50%), hallucinations/delusions (48%), agitation/irritable (40%), confusion (25%), mydriasis (19%), hypertension (10%), and drowsiness/lethargy (10%). The most common treatments were IV fluids (52%), benzodiazepines (38%), activated charcoal (17%), and cathartic (10%). Conclusion: Few hallucinogenic tryptamine exposures were reported to this poison center system, and the number does not appear to be increasing. The most common drugs were DMT and AMT. The patients tended to be young and male. The drugs were most often ingested. The majority of exposures had serious outcomes and were managed at healthcare facilities.

N2  - Cortical 5HT2A receptors are largely expressed in layer 5 pyramidal neurons and appear to play a pivotal role in brain function in that they gate top-down descending inputs to local cortical microcircuits. There is evidence that they may play a role in depression in that the number of these receptors is increased in some people with depression and the augmenting action of atypical antipsychotics in depression is thought to be - at least in part - due to blockade of these receptors. We have explored this possibility by studying the effects of agonists at these receptors - the psychedelic druds psilocybin and LSD. We found they had profound effects to reduce brain activity particularly in regions that higly express the 5HT2A receptor such as the default mode network [DMN]. As this region is overactive in depression this may explain the improvements in mood that users of psychedelic often report.

N2  - Social cognition is a crucial factor influencing development, progress, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, social cognition skills are insufficiently targeted by current treatment approaches. In particular, patients suffering from depression show an increased negative reaction to social exclusion and deficits in empathy. The 5HT-1A/2A receptor agonist psilocybin has previously been shown to reduce the neural response to negative emotional stimuli. However, it is not known if this extends to negative social interaction and whether 5HT-1A/2A receptor stimulation induces changes in empathy. Given the clear need for improved treatment of sociocognitive functioning in psychiatric disorders, it is important to better understand the neuronal and neuromodulatory substrates of social cognition. In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design we therefore investigated the neural response to ostracism after the acute administration of psilocybin (0.215mg/kg) and placebo in healthy volunteers using fMRI. Furthermore, we assessed cognitive and emotional empathy using the Multifaceted Empathy Test. The neural response to social exclusion in the ACC - a brain region associated with 'social pain'- was reduced after psilocybin administration compared to placebo. Furthermore, emotional empathy was enhanced after treatment with psilocybin while no significant differences were found in cognitive empathy. These results show that the 5HT-1A/2A receptor subtypes play an important role in the modulation of socio-cognitive functioning and therefore may be relevant for the treatment of social cognition deficits in psychiatric disorders. In particular, they may be important for the normalization of empathy deficits and increased negative reaction to social exclusion in depressed patients.

N2  - Hallucinogenic substances have been used for millenia. Still, the scientific investigation into the effects and mechanisms of classical hallucinogens in humans has only commenced with the discovery of LSD by Albert Hofmann in 1943. In the 1960's, there were more than a thousand clinical studies that reported promising therapeutic effects of LSD and psilocybin in psychiatric patients. Only recently, however, the neuropharmacological and neurobiological underpinnings of hallucinogenic drugs have undergone systematic investigations. Despite having different chemical structures, classical hallucinogens produce striking similar subjective and behavioral effects in both animals and humans. Activation of the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor is a core feature in hallucinogenic pharmacology. Recent neuroimaging studies have begun to elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying hallucinogen-induced changes of thought, perception, and mood. Among the many networks involved in hallucinogen-related states of consciousness, the prefrontal cortex and the limbic regions appear to be especially relevant to the putative antidepressant effects of classical hallucinogens. Furthermore, hallucinogens may foster neuroplastic adaptations within cortico-subcortical brain networks. This appears to be a promising mechanism with regard to future clinical studies into the effects of classical hallucinogens in depression and anxiety.

N2  - Background: There is a long history of research interest in the therapeutic benefits of 'psychedelic' drugs including D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin (the active component in 'magic mushrooms') and MDMA (ecstasy). Studies in psychiatry during the 1950s and 1960s reported benefits from their use in the treatment of a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and alcoholism. However, inconsistent and adverse findings along with the widespread abuse of psychedelic drugs resulted in a ban on their use in clinical practice. Renewed research interest emerged with the landmark Johns Hopkins study on psilocybin in 2008. Further studies since then have examined the effectiveness of psilocybin in helping people to quit smoking and the effectiveness of psilocybin/LSD-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of anxiety associated with end-stage cancer. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Science (MAPS) has been a source of funding for international trials of psychedelic drugs, particularly trials that have focused on the use of MDMA in war veterans suffering from treatment resistant Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. Objectives: To increase awareness of the therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs and to encourage further research within Australia. Methods: A review of the current literature on psychedelic drug research. Findings: There is a growing body of evidence showing that psychedelic drugs can make a major contribution to effective treatment in psychiatry. Conclusions: Many arguments against the use of psychedelic drugs are moral rather than medical. Further research and investigation is needed to lift the taboo on these drugs and reveal their potential benefits.

N2  - Objective: Exploring nature and collecting plants and mushrooms as food items for the new Nordic kitchen has evolved in recent years. This behaviour has led to several cases of improper intake of fresh mushrooms resulting in poisonings requiring advanced treatment. Based on clinical symptoms mushrooms intake can be divided in toxic syndromes. We evaluated the representation of nine mushroom syndromes in the Danish mushroom poisoning profile from January 2006 to October 2014. Methods: Enquires about mushroom poisoning to the Danish Poisons Information Centre (DPIC) were collected, reviewed and divided in the nine mushroom syndromes based on the xenobiotic content of the mushrooms and symptomatology: amatoxin, gyromitrin, muscarine, disulfiram-like, anticholinergic, psilocybin, gastrointestinal, orellanin and haemolytic syndromes.1 Unidentified but non-symptomatic exposures and other, identified but non-toxic exposures were additional groups. Results: Mushroom exposures represented approximately 2% of all calls to DPIC in 2006-2013, with a slight increasing tendency in the last 4 years. Mushroom exposure syndromes are seasonal in the autumn peaking in September, except psilocybin which is represented evenly throughout the entire year. Mushroom syndrome distributions in 2006-2014 are shown in Table 1. Mushrooms causing gastrointestinal symptoms were most frequent. In 68 cases, cytotoxic mushroom ingestion (amatoxin, gyromitrin and orellanin) caused severe and potentially life-threatening poisoning, with the amatoxin syndrome as most dominant. The unidentified mushrooms mainly involved mushrooms partly identified by process of elimination (i.e. not cytotoxic species). The non-toxic mushrooms mainly involving accidental ingestion in children. Conclusion: Collecting mushrooms for food without comprehensive knowledge of edible species and their toxic counterparts caused several severe poisonings, primarily within the amatoxin and gastrointestinal syndromes. Preventive measures in terms of information and education are needed, combined with online guidance for mushroom collectors. (Table Presented).

N2  - Objective: The classification of mushroom poisoning is arguably useful for clinicians managing cases as it may assist in the diagnostic process. Existing schemes do not account for newly identified types of mushroom poisoning. In attempting to rectify this problem we have developed a new classification scheme and used this to inform development of a diagnostic algorithm based on clinical presentation, for cases where the identity of the consumed mushrooms is uncertain. Methods: We undertook a literature review using the term "mushroom poisoning" and then targeted searches based on particular identified mushroom genera/species. Papers defining newer syndromes of mushroom poisoning, not covered in earlier classifications, were selected for more detailed review. Poisoning syndromes were included where there was clear delineation of distinctive clinical features, usually with additional data on culprit species. A matrix of principal clinical effects for each syndrome was created, tabulating common and unique features and this was used to construct a diagnostic algorithm. Results: Over 1,600 papers were identified, from which a core set of 75 were considered. This yielded 21 distinct mushroom poisoning syndromes which were the basis for the new classification and diagnostic algorithm. We propose 6 broad groups, most with subgroups. Group 1 - Cytotoxic mushroom poisoning; specific major internal organ pathology, causing either primary hepatotoxicity or primary nephrotoxicity. 1A, primary hepatotoxicity (amatoxins); 1B, early primary nephrotoxicity (amino hexadienoic acid; AHDA); 1C, delayed primary nephrotoxicity (orellanines). Group 2 - Neurotoxic mushroom poisoning; poisoning causing primary neurotoxicity. 2A, hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybins and related toxins); 2B, autonomic-toxicity mushrooms (muscarines); 2C, CNS-toxicity mushrooms (ibotenic acid/muscimol); 2D, morel neurologic syndrome (Morchella spp.). Group 3 - Myotoxic mushroom poisoning. 3A, rapid onset (Russula spp.); 3B, delayed onset (Tricholoma spp.). Group 4 - Metabolic-toxicity mushroom poisoning; includes a wide variety of poisoning syndromes and clinical presentations. 4A, GABA-blocking mushroom poisoning (gyromitrins); 4B, disulfiram-like (coprines); 4C, polyporic mushroom poisoning (polyporic acid); 4D, trichothecene mushroom poisoning (Podostroma spp.); 4E, hypoglycaemic mushroom poisoning (Trogia venenata); 4F, hyperprocalcitoninemia mushroom poisoning (Boletus satanas); 4G, pancytopenic mushroom poisoning (Ganoderma neojaponicum). Group 5 - Gastrointestinal irritant mushroom poisoning. Group 6 - Miscellaneous adverse reactions to mushrooms. 6A, Shiitake mushroom dermatitis; 6B, erythromelagic mushrooms (Clitocybe acromelagia); 6C, Paxillus syndrome (Paxillus involutus); 6D, encephalopathy syndrome (Pleurocybella porrigens). The diagnostic algorithm consists of 6 linked sections covering all 5 groups and 21 poisoning syndromes. Conclusion: The proposed classification and diagnostic algorithm may need adjustment as new poisoning syndromes emerge.

N2  - Background: Social cognition is a crucial factor influencing development, progress, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. Particularly, depressed patients show an increased negative reaction to social exclusion and deficits in empathy. The 5-HT2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin has been reported to reduce the neural response to negative stimuli. However, it is not known if this extends to negative social interaction and whether 5-HT2A/1A receptor stimulation affects empathy. Given the clear need for improved treatment of socio-cognitive functioning in psychiatric disorders, it is important to better understand the neuronal and neuromodulatory substrates of social cognition. Methods: This study assessed the neural response to ostracism after the acute administration of psilocybin (0.215mg/kg) and placebo in 21 healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, we assessed cognitive and emotional empathy using the Multifaceted Empathy Test. A double- blind, randomized, cross-over design was applied with volunteers counterbalanced to receive psilocybin and placebo in two sessions at least 10 days apart. Results: The neural response to social exclusion was reduced in the dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (peak: x=6,y=26,z=22,p<0.05,FWE) after psilocybin administration versus placebo. Emotional empathy was increased after psilocybin administration (F(1,31)=7.09,p0.27). Conclusions: These results indicate that the 5-HT2A/1A receptor subtypes play an important role in the modulation of socio-cognitive functioning and therefore may be relevant for the treatment of social cognition deficits in psychiatric disorders. In particular, they may be important for the normalization of empathy deficits and increased negative reaction to social exclusion in depressed patients.

N2  - Introduction: Several cases of poisoning hallucinogenic mushrooms are reported each year in France. There are more than 150 species of hallucinogenic mushrooms which 90 are of the type Psylocybe. Psilocybin-containing mushrooms have long been sought after and consumed for their hallucinogenic properties. Psilocybin and psilocin are the active compounds, responsible for the effects including altered perceptions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, anxiety, and an altered perception of time. Material and methods: We review the epidemiological, pharmacological and toxicological data now available for these hallucinogenic compounds. Results: Mushrooms are natural hallucinogenic substances most consumed in France [1]. The highest proportion of adult consumers is in the age group of 26- 44 years. As for all illicit substances, its use is more common in men. ESCAPAD investigation conducted by OFDT in young people of 17 years old shows that a significant proportion of them has already experimented the hallucinogenic mushrooms (4.2%); percentage equivalent to those of ecstasy use in the same population (4.1%). The factors cited that influence their decision to try hallucinogenic mushrooms for the first time were 'curiosity', 'to achieve a mystical experience', and 'introspection'. The website selling hallucinogenic mushrooms is the "Shayana Shop" site, which is the current average now recognized to have informations about modes of consumption, desired effects and risks incurred after hallucinogenic mushrooms consumption. Some severe complications were reported in literature including convulsions, renal and hematological toxicity, heart attack and two fatal cases after mushrooms abuse [2-5]. Discussion/Conclusion: Of particular interest in hallucinogenic mushroom abuse are: the increased recreational consumption in young people, the ease of obtaining these compounds via internet and the possibility of severe and fatal complications. Prevention of hallucinogenic mushroom intoxications seems justified. Indeed, even if these poisonings appear slightly dangerous, psychiatric, somatic and toxicological risks are real.

N2  - Aims: Although classic hallucinogens have relatively low physiological toxicity and do not produce compulsive drug seeking, they can produce adverse psychological reactions (i.e., 'bad trips'). An online survey study sought to better characterize such experiences. Methods: Participants completed an anonymous online survey in reference to their most challenging experience after ingesting psilocybin mushrooms. The experience was required not to have occurred in the context of a research study. The questionnaire assessed the phenomenology of the experience. Results: There were 1853 participants (mean age 29 yrs; 81% male; 50% college or graduate degree). 39% rated the experience as among the 5 most challenging experiences of their lives, and 34% rated the experience as among the 5 most meaningful of their lives. Scores on the Challenging Experience Questionnaire showed a reasonably high correlation with ratings of difficulty of experience (r = 0.516), but not with ratings of the degree of spiritual significance (r = 0.125). In contrast, scores on the Mystical Experience Questionnaire correlated moderately highly with spiritual significance ratings (r = 0.658) but not with degree of difficulty (r = 0.198). Consistent with known effects of psilocybin, participants endorsed visual effects (61%) and auditory (23%) and visual (21%) synesthesia. Anomalous experiences were endorsed, including: interactions with entities/persons not physically present (29%), convincing experiences of prior lives (10%), and experiences of Jamais vu (17%). 11% reported that they put themselves or others at risk for physical harm during the experience. Conclusions: Participants completed a survey about their most challenging experience after psilocybin. Scores of challenging experience and mystical experience showed different patterns of correlations. Visual and auditory effects and unusual phenomenology were reported.

N2  - Aims: Acute adverse psychological reactions ("bad trips") to classic hallucinogens (such as psilocybin and LSD), while usually benign with proper preparation before and support during the time of drug action, remain a clinical concern for human research, and a safety concern for recreational use. Anecdotal and clinical evidence suggests that anxiety, panic, depression, and confusion are potential adverse reactions to classic hallucinogens. We apply psychometric analysis to investigate the profile of challenging experiences with psychedelics, and relate this profile to ratings of the overall impact of the experiences. Methods: We analyzed responses (N= 1853) to an online survey study of "bad trips" with psilocybin, and used exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of stratified sub samples to construct and validate a Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) from responses to items from the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS), the States of Consciousness Questionnaire (SOCQ), and the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire (5DASC). Results: Scores from 29 items of the HRS, SOCQ, and 5DASC loaded onto a 6 factors of the CEQ (grief, fear, death, insanity, isolation, and physical distress). These factors differentially predicted the rated difficulty, meaningfulness, spiritual significance, and change in well-being attributed to the challenging effects. Conclusions: Scores on CEQ factors form a phenomenological profile of challenging experiences with psilocybin, and may provide a framework within which to investigate predictors and persisting effects of these experiences.

N2  - Aims: Pilot laboratory results suggest psilocybin may be an efficacious adjunct to smoking cessation treatment. However, no study has examined smoking cessation after psychedelic use in naturalistic settings. Methods: We are conducting an online survey collecting demographics, smoking history, and other data from people who self-report quitting/reducing smoking after taking a psychedelic. Results: Among current completers (N= 164), LSD (49%) and psilocybin (32%) were the drugs most commonly associated with quitting/reducing, with a mode of 2-5 lifetime uses each. Participants reported smoking a mean of 12 cigs/day for a mean of 8 yrs before the experience. 62 (38%) reported total and continuing abstinence after their experience, with 29 of the 62 (47%) reporting >1 yr abstinence, and 7 (11%) reporting >10 yrs abstinence. Another 67 of the 164 (41%) reported persisting smoking reduction, from a mode of 10-20 cigs/day before, to a mode of <1 cig/month after the experience. The remaining 35 (21%) reported temporary reduction, with 6 of the 35 (17%) reporting >1 yr reduction. Although the majority of withdrawal symptoms were rated as equal in severity to previous quit attempts, depression, irritability, anxiety, and craving were rated as "much less severe." 141 of the 164 (86%) reported no premeditated intention to quit/reduce smoking, and 159 (97%) described their experience as highly meaningful, with 97 (59%) considering it among the 10 most meaningful experiences of their lives. Participants cited changed life priorities/values (26%), strengthened belief in their ability to quit (26%), and changed future orientation (17%) as the most important effects leading to quitting/reducing. Other changes reported after psychedelic use included reduced alcohol (38%) and other drug use (23%). Conclusions: Psychedelics may prompt temporary or prolonged smoking cessation, suggesting that careful administration in a treatment context may enhance motivation in changing addictive behaviors. Psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying such behavioral changes require further investigation.

N2  - Aims: Salvinorin-A is a terpene found in the leaves of the plant Salvia divinorum. When administered to humans, salvinorin-A induces an intense but short-lasting modified state of awareness, sharing features with those induced by the serotonergic psychedelics. However, unlike substances such as psilocybin, or mescaline, salvinorin-A shows affinity in vitro for the kappa-opioid receptor rather than for the serotonin-2A receptor. In the present study we aimed to assess whether the subjective effects induced by salvinorin-A in humans are caused by the drug's interaction with opioid receptors. Methods: Eight healthy volunteers participated in four experimental sessions. They received the following drug combinations one week apart: placebo/placebo, placebo/salvinorin-A, naltrexone/ placebo and naltrexone/salvinorin-A. Naltrexone was administered at a dose of 50mg orally and salvinorin-A at 1mg vaporized. Subjective effects were assessed using visual analog scales (VAS), the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS), the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) and the Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire (APZ). Results: After the placebo pre-treatment, salvinorin-A induced an intense dream-like state characterized by significant increases in VAS measuring modifications in body perception, perception of time, detachment from external reality and visual imagery. Significant increases were also observed in all subscales of the HRS and APZ and in the LSD subscale of the ARCI. These effects were effectively prevented by naltrexone. Following pre-treatment with this non-specific opioid antagonist, the intensity of subjective effects induced by salvinorin-A was markedly attenuated and scores on the administered instruments were significantly decreased. Conclusions: These results support opioid receptor agonism as the mechanism of action underlying the subjective effects of salvinorin-A in humans.

T1  - Does the nervous system have an intrinsic archaic language? entoptic images and phosphenes
A1  - Umit Sayin H. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Psychoactive plants have been consumed by many cultures, cults and groups during religious rituals and ceremonies for centuries and they have been influential on the eruption of many images, secret and religious symbols, esoteric geometrical shapes, archetypes, religious figures, and philosophy of religions since the dawn of Homo sapiens. Some of the psychoactive plants used for religious purposes were: narcotic analgesics (opium), THC (cannabis), psilocybin (magic mushrooms), mescaline (peyote), ibogaine (Tabernanthe iboga), DMT (Ayahuasca and Phalaris species), Peganum harmala, bufotenin, muscimol (Amanita muscaria), Thujone (absinthe, Arthemisia absinthium), ephedra, mandragora, star lotus, Salvia divinorum etc. An important property of these natural chemicals is to induce the human psyche to perceive optical forms and shapes that are existent in the subconscious and presumed collective unconsciousness, and which emerge during certain trance states and ASCs (altered states of consciousness). Some of these simple geometric forms are called entoptic images and phosphenes. Entopic images and phosphenes have been found in various cultural works of art and in the drawings on cave walls, which were formed during shamanic religious rituals since Neolithic times. Also entoptic images exist in many folkloric, traditional and cultural geometrical shapes. Long before the creation of languages, visual perception and information were the only source for mankind, alone of the primates, to perceive the outer world. This article reviews the possibility of an ancient forgotten language of visual signs and symbols, which is genetically existent in the human brain and emerges during ASCs, trance states, and consciousness altered by psychoactive plants.Copyright © 2014, NeuroQuantology.

T1  - The consumption of psychoactive plants during religious rituals: The roots of common symbols and figures in religions and myths
A1  - Umit Sayin H. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Psychoactive plants which contain hallucinogenic molecules that induce a form of altered states of consciousness (HASC) have been widely used during the religious rituals of many cultures throughout the centuries, while the consumption of these plants for spiritual and religious purposes is as old as human history. Some of those cultures were shaman and pagan subcultures; African native religions; Bwiti Cult; South American native religions; Amazon Cultures; Central American Cultures; Mexican subcultures; Aztec, Maya and Inca; Wiccan and witch subcultures; Satanists; American Indians; Greek and Hellenistic cultures; Sufis; Hassan Sabbah's Hashissins; Hindu, Indian and Tibetan cultures; some of the Nordic subcultures etc. Some of the psychoactive ingredients of the plants that were used during these religious rituals were; narcotic analgesics (opium), THC (cannabis), psilocybin (magic mushrooms), mescaline (peyote), ibogaine (Tabernanthe iboga), DMT (Ayahuasca and phalaris species), Peganum harmala, bufotenin, muscimol (Amanita muscaria), thujone (absinthe, Arthemisia absinthium), ephedra, mandragora, star lotus, Salvia divinorum etc. The main purposes of the practice of these plants were: spiritual healing; to contact with spirits; to contact with the souls of ancestors; to reach enlightenment (Nirvana or Satori); to become a master shaman, pagan or witch; to reach so-called-other realities, etc. Such "psychedelic-philosophical plant rituals" changed participating persons' psychology, philosophy and personality to a great degree. In these two successive articles, the consumption of psychedelic plants during religious rituals is reviewed and it is hypothesized that the images, figures, illusions and hallucinations experienced during these "plant trips" had a great impact on the formation and creation of many figures, characters, creatures, archetype images that exist not only in the mythology, but also in many religions, as well, such as angels, demons, Satan, mythological creatures, gods, goddesses etc. In the Middle East and Anatolia, within many hermetic and pagan religions, Greek and Hellenic cultures psychoactive plant use was a serious part of the religious rituals, such as Dionysian rituals or Witch's' Sabbaths. Although the impact of the "psychedelic experience and imagination" was enormous to the configuration of many religious and mythological characters, and archetypes, this fact has been underestimated and even unnoticed by many historians and anthropologists, because of the quasi-ethical trends of "anti-drug-brain-washed Western Societies".

N2  - Networks, as efficient representations of complex systems, have appealed to scientists for a long time and now permeate many areas of science, including neuroimaging (Bullmore and Sporns 2009 Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 10, 186-198. (doi:10.1038/nrn2618)). Traditionally, the structure of complex networks has been studied through their statistical properties and metrics concerned with node and link properties, e.g. degree-distribution, node centrality andmodularity. Here, we study the characteristics of functional brain networks at the mesoscopic level from a novel perspective that highlights the role of inhomogeneities in the fabric of functional connections. This can be done by focusing on the features of a set of topological objects - homological cycles - associated with the weighted functional network. We leverage the detected topological information to define the homological scaffolds, a new set of objects designed to represent compactly the homological features of the correlation network and simultaneouslymake their homological properties amenable to networks theoretical methods. As a proof of principle, we apply these tools to compare restingstate functional brain activity in 15 healthy volunteers after intravenous infusion of placebo and psilocybin - the main psychoactive component of magic mushrooms. The results showthat the homological structure of the brain's functional patterns undergoes a dramatic change post-psilocybin, characterized by the appearance of many transient structures of low stability and of a small number of persistent ones that are not observed in the case of placebo.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

T1  - Pharmacology should be at the centre of all preclinical and clinical studies on new psychoactive substances (recreational drugs)
A1  - Green A.R.
A1  - Nutt D.J. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Despite the publication of a substantial body of preclinical and clinical information on recent recreational drugs such as 3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') and cathinone compounds such as mephedrone there remains a disturbing lack of consensus as to how dangerous these compounds are to the health of the individual and to society in general. This perspective proposes that use of good pharmacological practice should be mandatory in all preclinical and clinical studies. Its use will assist both translation and reverse translation of information produced in animals and clinical subjects. We propose several basic rules to be followed in all future studies. Preclinical studies should employ pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic integration thereby exposing animals to known or calculable drug concentrations. This will provide results relevant to pharmacology rather than toxicology and, crucially, data relevant to human drug use. Full experimental detail should be routinely provided, to allow comparison with other similar work. In clinical studies evidence should be provided that the drug under investigation has been ingested by the subjects being examined, and details given of all other drugs being ingested. Drug-drug interactions are an unavoidable confound but studies of a size that allows reliable statistical evaluation and preferably allows sub-group analysis, particularly by using meta-analysis, should help with this problem. This may require greater collaboration between investigative groups, as routinely occurs during pharmaceutical clinical trials. Other proposals include greater integration of preclinical and clinical scientists in both preclinical and clinical studies and changes in the law regarding Good Manufacturing Process (GMP) sourcing of drug for human studies. © The Author(s) 2014.

T1  - Dimethyltryptamine (DMT): Prevalence, user characteristics and abuse liability in a large global sample

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - This paper presents original research on prevalence, user characteristics and effect profile of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a potent hallucinogenic which acts primarily through the serotonergic system. Data were obtained from the Global Drug Survey (an anonymous online survey of people, many of whom have used drugs) conducted between November and December 2012 with 22,289 responses. Lifetime prevalence of DMT use was 8.9% (n=1980) and past year prevalence use was 5.0% (n=1123). We explored the effect profile of DMT in 472 participants who identified DMT as the last new drug they had tried for the first time and compared it with ratings provided by other respondents on psilocybin (magic mushrooms), LSD and ketamine. DMT was most often smoked and offered a strong, intense, short-lived psychedelic high with relatively few negative effects or "come down". It had a larger proportion of new users compared with the other substances (24%), suggesting its popularity may increase. Overall, DMT seems to have a very desirable effect profile indicating a high abuse liability that maybe offset by a low urge to use more. © The Author(s) 2013.

N2  - Hallucinogen-based interventions may benefit substance use populations, but contemporary data informing the impact of hallucinogens on addictive behavior are scarce. Given that many individuals in the criminal justice system engage in problematic patterns of substance use, hallucinogen treatments also may benefit criminal justice populations. However, the relationship between hallucinogen use and criminal recidivism is unknown. In this longitudinal study, we examined the relationship between naturalistic hallucinogen use and recidivism among individuals under community corrections supervision with a history of substance involvement (n=25,622). We found that hallucinogen use predicted a reduced likelihood of supervision failure (e.g. noncompliance with legal requirements including alcohol and other drug use) while controlling for an array of potential confounding factors (odds ratio (OR)=0.60 (0.46, 0.79)). Our results suggest that hallucinogens may promote alcohol and other drug abstinence and prosocial behavior in a population with high rates of recidivism. © The Author(s) 2013.

N2  - Emotional face processing is critically modulated by the serotonergic system. For instance, emotional face processing is impaired by acute psilocybin administration, a serotonin (5-HT) 1A and 2A receptor agonist. However, the spatiotemporal brain mechanisms underlying these modulations are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal brain dynamics underlying psilocybin-induced modulations during emotional face processing. Electrical neuroimaging analyses were applied to visual evoked potentials in response to emotional faces, following psilocybin and placebo administration. Our results indicate a first time period of strength (i.e., Global Field Power) modulation over the 168-189 ms poststimulus interval, induced by psilocybin. A second time period of strength modulation was identified over the 211-242 ms poststimulus interval. Source estimations over these 2 time periods further revealed decreased activity in response to both neutral and fearful faces within limbic areas, including amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, and the right temporal cortex over the 168-189 ms interval, and reduced activity in response to happy faces within limbic and right temporo-occipital brain areas over the 211-242 ms interval. Our results indicate a selective and temporally dissociable effect of psilocybin on the neuronal correlates of emotional face processing, consistent with a modulation of the top-down control.Copyright © The Author 2013.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - The use of herbal therapies is ancient and increasing worldwide. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the efficacy of various "complementary" and alternative medicine approaches in the management of headache disorders. Promising tools to treat migraine patients are herbal products. In particular constituents of Petasites hybridus, Tanacetum Parthenium and Ginkgo Biloba have shown antimigraine action in clinical studies. A miscellaneous of recreational drugs and other herbal remedies have been supposed to have a role in headache treatment but quality of clinical studies in this field is low and inconclusive. Further research is warranted in this area. © 2014 European Union.

T1  - The use of magnetoencephalography in the study of psychopharmacology (pharmaco-MEG)
A1  - Muthukumaraswamy S.D. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging technique that allows direct measurement of the magnetic fields generated by synchronised ionic neural currents in the brain with moderately good spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. Because chemical neuromodulation can cause changes in neuronal processing on the millisecond time-scale, the combination of MEG with pharmacological interventions (pharmaco-MEG) is a powerful tool for measuring the effects of experimental modulations of neurotransmission in the living human brain. Importantly, pharmaco-MEG can be used in both healthy humans to understand normal brain function and in patients to understand brain pathologies and drug-treatment effects. In this paper, the physiological and technical basis of pharmaco-MEG is introduced and contrasted with other pharmacological neuroimaging techniques. Ongoing developments in MEG analysis techniques such as source-localisation, functional and effective connectivity analyses, which have allowed for more powerful inferences to be made with recent pharmaco-MEG data, are described. Studies which have utilised pharmaco-MEG across a range of neurotransmitter systems (GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin) are reviewed. © The Author(s) 2014.

T1  - Why Psychiatry Needs Psychedelics and Psychedelics Need Psychiatry
A1  - Sessa B. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Without researching psychedelic drugs for medical therapy, psychiatry is turning its back on a group of compounds that could have great potential. Without the validation of the medical profession, the psychedelic drugs, and those who take them off-license, remain archaic sentiments of the past, with the users maligned as recreational drug abusers and subject to continued negative opinion. These two disparate groups-psychiatrists and recreational psychedelic drug users-are united by their shared recognition of the healing potential of these compounds. A resolution of this conflict is essential for the future of psychiatric medicine and psychedelic culture alike. Progression will come from professionals working in the field adapting to fit a conservative paradigm. In this way, they can provide the public with important treatments and also raise the profile of expanded consciousness in mainstream society. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

T1  - The Heffter Research Institute: Past and Hopeful Future
A1  - Nichols D.E. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - This essay describes the founding of the Heffter Research Institute in 1993 and its development up to the present. The Institute is the only scientific research organization dedicated to scientific research into the medical value of psychedelics, and it has particularly focused on the use of psilocybin. The first clinical treatment study was of the value of psilocybin in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Next was a UCLA study of psilocybin to treat end-of-life distress in end-stage cancer patients. While that study was ongoing, a trial was started at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) to study the efficacy of psilocybin in treating anxiety and depression resulting from a cancer diagnosis. Following the successful completion of the UCLA project, a larger study was started at New York University, which is near completion. A pilot study of the value of psilocybin in treating alcoholism at the University of New Mexico also is nearing completion, with a larger two-site study being planned. Other studies underway involve the use of psilocybin in a smoking cessation program and a study of the effects of psilocybin in long-term meditators, both at JHU. The institute is now planning for a Phase 3 clinical trial of psilocybin to treat distress in end-stage cancer patients. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Objective. Over the last few years, a wide number of unregulated substances have been marketed on the Web and in smart and head shops; they are usually advertised as legal alternatives to commonly known drugs and are defined as "smart drugs," "legal highs," and "novel psychoactive substances" (NPS). Aim of our work is to describe use habits and distribution of NPS in a population of young adults in Rome club scene. Methods. A self-administered questionnaire was proposed to subjects over 18 years of age at the entrance of 5 nightclubs in Rome. Socioeconomic characteristics and substance use were investigated. Results. Preliminary results give evidence that 78% of respondents have a lifetime history of NPS use. In addition, 56% of the sample has consumed illicit drugs in the past and 39% has used psychoactive substances in the 12 hours preceding the questionnaire administration. Conclusions. A significant proportion of subjects report use of novel psychoactive substances; traditional illicit drugs consumption, particularly cocaine, appears to be very high as well in the club scene. These data highlight a serious public health challenge, since pharmacological, toxicological, and psychopathological effects linked to interactions among all these substances may be unpredictable and sometimes fatal in vulnerable individuals.Copyright © 2014 Alessandro Emiliano Vento et al.

N2  - Microchemistry provides methods to analyze small quantities of chemical substances, including proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates in various fields such as biomedical research, tissue engineering, molecular biology, and regeneration medicine. We therefore developed a fluorescent capillary isoelectric focusing (fluorescent cIEF) system for protein detection at an ultramicroscale volume, which aimed to isolate and identify, from a heterogeneous mixture of transduced cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that could be fully reprogrammed. In addition, we demonstrated that the SOX2 protein, which is indispensable for the acquisition of pluripotency, could be detected by this new fluorescent cIEF system to identify iPSCs in the early phase of complete reprogramming. This method took less than 1. h for completion, including the time required for the antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) reaction, and required as few as approximately three cells. Thus, this system could help improve iPSC generation as well as cut costs and reduce workloads. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is a primary target of psychedelic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamine, mescaline, and psilocybin, which reproduce some of the core symptoms of schizophrenia. An incompletely resolved paradox is that only some 5-HT2A receptor agonists exhibit hallucinogenic activity, whereas structurally related agonists with comparable affinity and activity lack such a psychoactive activity. Using a strategy combining stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture with enrichment in phosphorylated peptides by means of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography followed by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, we compared the phosphoproteome in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing the 5-HT2A receptor and exposed to either vehicle or the synthetic hallucinogen 1-[2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl]-2- aminopropane (DOI) or the nonhallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonist lisuride. Among the 5995 identified phosphorylated peptides, 16 sites were differentially phosphorylated upon exposure of cells to DOI versus lisuride. These include a serine (Ser280) located in the third intracellular loop of the 5-HT2A receptor, a region important for its desensitization. The specific phosphorylation of Ser280 by hallucinogens was further validated by quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of immunopurified receptor digests and by Western blotting using a phosphosite specific antibody. The administration of DOI, but not of lisuride, to mice, enhanced the phosphorylation of 5-HT2A receptors at Ser280 in the prefrontal cortex. Moreover, hallucinogens induced a less pronounced desensitization of receptoroperated signaling in HEK-293 cells and neurons than did nonhallucinogenic agonists. The mutation of Ser280 to aspartic acid (to mimic phosphorylation) reduced receptor desensitization by nonhallucinogenic agonists, whereas its mutation to alanine increased the ability of hallucinogens to desensitize the receptor. This study reveals a biased phosphorylation of the 5-HT2A receptor in response to hallucinogenic versus nonhallucinogenic agonists, which underlies their distinct capacity to desensitize the receptor. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

N2  - Psilocybin, a psychoactive alkaloid contained in hallucinogenic mushrooms, is nowadays given a lot of attention in the scientific community as a research tool for modeling psychosis as well as due to its potential therapeutic effects. However, it is also a very popular and frequently abused natural hallucinogen. This review summarizes all the past and recent knowledge on psilocybin. It briefly deals with its history, discusses the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and compares its action in humans and animals. It attempts to describe the mechanism of psychedelic effects and objectify its action using modern imaging and psychometric methods. Finally, it describes its therapeutic and abuse potential. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

N2  - Perturbing a system and observing the consequences is a classic scientific strategy for understanding a phenomenon. Psychedelic drugs perturb consciousness in a marked and novel way and thus are powerful tools for studying its mechanisms. In the present analysis, we measured changes in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between a standard template of different independent components analysis (ICA)-derived resting state networks (RSNs) under the influence of two different psychoactive drugs, the stimulant/psychedelic hybrid, MDMA, and the classic psychedelic, psilocybin. Both were given in placebo-controlled designs and produced marked subjective effects, although reports of more profound changes in consciousness were given after psilocybin. Between-network RSFC was generally increased under psilocybin, implying that networks become less differentiated from each other in the psychedelic state. Decreased RSFC between visual and sensorimotor RSNs was also observed. MDMA had a notably less marked effect on between-network RSFC, implying that the extensive changes observed under psilocybin may be exclusive to classic psychedelic drugs and related to their especially profound effects on consciousness. The novel analytical approach applied here may be applied to other altered states of consciousness to improve our characterization of different conscious states and ultimately advance our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying them. © 2014 Roseman, Leech, Feilding, Nuttand Carhart-Harris.

N2  - Substance use patterns associated with the initiation of injection drug use were examined in a sample of low-threshold methadone-maintained injection drug users. Injection initiation tended to coincide with concurrent heavy alcohol and cannabis use, increasing use of stimulants such as cocaine, and the onset of prescription opioid and sedative misuse. Nearly half of the sample reported simultaneously using at least one other drug (excluding tobacco) during the first-ever injection drug use session, with alcohol being the most commonly co-administered substance. Findings suggest that specific patterns of multiple substance use may be appropriate targets for prevention of injection drug use.Copyright © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Objectives: Psychiatric medications are commonly used without a valid prescription for therapeutic and non-therapeutic reasons. This study aimed to examine the associated features of therapeutic and non-therapeutic motives for use among non-prescribed users of anxiolytic, sedative and stimulant medications recruited from the community. Method: Participants (n=72) completed face-to-face interviews and questionnaires assessing medication use and misuse, other substance use and non-substance-related psychopathology. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine factors relating to primary motives for use. Results: Non-therapeutic motives for use of anxiolytics, sedatives and stimulants were associated with a more extensive history of other substance use, as compared to therapeutic motives. Men were more likely than women to report using anxiolytics and sedatives for non-therapeutic motives. No symptoms of psychopathology, including anxiety disorders or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, were related to motives for non-prescribed medication use. Although patterns of use tended to correspond with self-reported motives, in some cases, users reported therapeutic motives while describing high-risk patterns of use. Conclusion: These results demonstrate important heterogeneity within non-prescribed medication users that a unitary conceptualization fails to adequately capture.Copyright © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - The involvement of the serotonin system in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has been elucidated by experiments with hallucinogens. Application of a hallucinogen to humans leads to changes in perception, cognition, emotions, and induction of psychotic-like symptoms that resemble symptoms of schizophrenia. In rodent studies, their acute administration affects sensorimotor gating, locomotor activity, social behavior, and cognition including working memory, the phenotypes are considered as an animal model of schizophrenia. The complexity and singularity of human cognition raises questions about the validity of animal models utilizing agonists of 5-HT2A receptors. The present study thus investigated the effect of psilocin on memory acquisition, reinforced retrieval, and memory consolidation in rats. Psilocin is a main metabolite of psilocybin acting as an agonist at 5-HT2A receptors with a contribution of 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptors. First, we tested the effect of psilocin on the acquisition of a Carousel maze, a spatial task requiring navigation using distal cues, attention, and cognitive coordination. Psilocin significantly impaired the acquisition of the Carousel maze at both doses (1 and 4 mg/kg). The higher dose of psilocin blocked the learning processes even in an additional session when the rats received only saline. Next, we examined the effect of psilocin on reinforced retrieval and consolidation in the Morris water maze (MWM). The dose of 4 mg/kg disrupted reinforced retrieval in the MWM. However, the application of a lower dose was without any significant effect. Finally, neither the low nor high dose of psilocin injected post-training caused a deficit in memory consolidation in the MWM. Taken together, the psilocin dose dependently impaired the acquisition of the Carousel maze and reinforced retrieval in MWM; however, it had no effect on memory consolidation. © 2014 Rambousek, Palenicek, Vales and Stuchlik.

T1  - Classical hallucinogens as antidepressants? A review of pharmacodynamics and putative clinical roles

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Hallucinogens have been part of spiritual practice for millennia, but controversy surrounding their mind-manifesting effects led to their proscription by the mid-20th century, largely without evidence of harm or toxicity and despite nascent data suggesting therapeutic utility in treating depressive illnesses. This review explores their pharmacodynamic actions and the current limited data on their clinic effectiveness. These drugs appear to exert their psychedelic effects through their agonist or partial agonist activity at the serotonergic 5-HT2A receptor, though they also have affinity for other metabotropic serotonin receptors. Hallucinogen binding affects a wide range of intracellular signalling pathways, the precise nature of which remains incompletely understood. They alter the serotonergic tone of brainstem raphe nuclei that project through the brain; they interact with receptors in the prefrontal cortex altering connectivity patterns and intracellular functioning; and they disrupt inhibitory control of sensory input via the thalamus to the cortex. The serotonergic system has long been implicated in anxiety and depressive disorders, and is a major target of most existing antidepressants. Classical hallucinogens alter the functioning of this system, but not in the same way current medications do: whilst there are identified receptors and neurotransmitter pathways through which hallucinogens could therein produce therapeutic effects, the neurobiology of this remains speculative at this time. There is currently an extremely limited but growing literature on hallucinogen safety and clinical application. The drugs appear well tolerated by healthy controls and clinical populations, and the rapid tolerance to repeated administration might reduce the possibility of dependency. Clinical trials reported over the past decade have generally shown positive therapeutic potential, but they are notably few in number. Legislative policy has had a freezing effect on evaluation of these compounds, a better understanding of which might improve our knowledge of the processes involved in consciousness, the neuropathology of depression, and potentially open up new pharmacological therapies. © The Author(s), 2014.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - The main target of alcohol and other drug self-administration is the brain. For this reason understanding of brain mechanisms (i.e., neuroscience research) may offer important insights for creating effective prevention and treatment interventions, as well as fair and appropriate drug policies. Fair and appropriate drug policies (public laws and regulations) are expected to reduce the harms of drugs to the user and to society in general, while minimizing unintended but related policy "side effects." In this paper we explore how more informed understanding of neuroscience may help to improve the effectiveness and reduce the unintended side effects of contemporary drug policies. The article goes on to suggest some rational ways neuroscience may better inform and assist in policy decisions. We cover currently illegal drugs plus others such as alcohol and tobacco and touch on the new and emerging substances-legal highs.

N2  - A procedure based on ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry has been developed for the determination of mescaline, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, psilocin, psilocybin, salvinorin A in hair of consumers of psychedelic vegetal material such peyote or trichocereus cacti, psilocybe mushrooms, Salvia divinorum or psychedelic beverage ayahuasca. After hair washing with methyl alcohol and diethyl ether and subsequent addition of mescaline-d9 and 3,4-methylenedioxypropylamphetamine as internal standards, hair samples were treated with 250mul VMA-T M3 reagent for 1h at 100degreeC. After cooling, 100mul M3 extract were diluted with 400mul water and a volume of 10mul was injected into chromatographic system. Chromatographic separation was achieved at ambient temperature using a reverse-phase column and a linear gradient elution with two solvents: 0.3% formic acid in acetonitrile and 5mM ammonium formate pH 3. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode, using multiple reaction monitoring via positive electrospray ionization.The method was linear from the limit of quantification (0.03-0.05. ng/mg depending on analyte under investigation) to 10. ng/mg hair, with an intra- and inter-assay imprecision and inaccuracy always less than 15% and an analytical recovery between 79.6% and 97.4%, depending on the considered analyte. Using the validated method, mescaline was found in concentration range of 0.08-0.13. ng/mg in hair of peyote smokers, 3.2. ng salvinorin A per mg hair were determined in hair from a S. divinorum smoker, 5.6. ng N,N-dimethyltryptamine per mg hair from an ayahuasca user and finally 0.8. ng psilocybin per ng hair of a psilocybe consumer. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Sources of Pharmaceutical Opioids for Non-Medical Use among Young Adults

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - The study uses qualitative and quantitative data to describe sources of pain pills for illicit use among young adult (18- to 23-year-old) users. Respondent-driven sampling was used to recruit 383 individuals in the Columbus, Ohio, area. The sample was almost 50% Caucasian and about 55% male. Qualitative interview participants (n = 45) were selected from the larger sample. Qualitative data suggest that pharmaceutical opioid availability was so pervasive that most individuals did not have to venture outside of their immediate social networks to find people who sold or shared pills. Participants emphasized differences between those who are actively involved in obtaining pills and those who play a more passive role. Active involvement was described as going out searching for pills and paying money to obtain them. In contrast, passive role included obtaining pills when somebody offered or shared them free of charge. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicates that a more active role in obtaining pharmaceutical opioids was related to being White, more frequent use of pharmaceutical opioids, extended-release oxycodone use, and using pharmaceutical opioids to get high, as opposed to self-treating a health problem. The study results can help inform drug use epidemiology, interventions, and policy. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

T1  - Drugs currently in Phase II clinical trials for cocaine addiction
A1  - Kim J.H.
A1  - Lawrence A.J. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Introduction: There are no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for treating cocaine addiction; thus, developing drugs to treat cocaine dependence is an unmet critical need. Fortunately, there are a number of drugs that are currently in Phase II clinical trial/s. This is due in part to the advances from in vivo imaging in humans which provided a roadmap of the neurochemistry of the cocaine-dependent brain. Most drugs currently in Phase II clinical trials attempt to modulate the disturbed neurochemistry in cocaine dependents to resemble those of healthy individuals. These predominantly modulate dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, GABA or noradrenaline signalling.Areas covered: This review summarizes the therapeutic potential of each drug as evidenced by clinical and preclinical studies. It also discusses their utility in terms of bioavailability and half-life.Expert opinion: Amphetamine salts and topiramate clearly stand out in terms of their potential efficacy in treating cocaine addiction. The efficacy of topiramate was closely associated with regular cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), which highlights the importance of a combined effort to promote abstinence and enhance retention via CBT. Cognitive/psychological screening appears necessary for a more symptom-based approach with more reasonable outcomes other than abstinence (e.g., improved quality of life) in treating cocaine addiction. © 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - This article presents two cases of adolescent males who were admitted to our inpatient psychiatric unit with a psychotic, disorganized presentation. Both males had a genetic vulnerability to mental illness and reported significant substance use. Their symptoms were refractory to treatment and required the use of clozapine. Both patients experienced significant side effects, which limited the maximum daily dose of clozapine. However, they responded to a dose that was much lower than that typically used in adults. There is significant evidence in the literature about cannabis use triggering psychotic breaks in vulnerable individuals. We speculate that substance use (including synthetic cannabinoids) triggers treatment-resistant psychosis that requires the use of clozapine. Further, lower doses of clozapine may be sufficient to treat the substance-induced psychotic symptoms than those typically used in adult schizophrenia. © 2014 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.

N2  - This study examines whether adult psychological distress and health risk behaviors mediate the relationship between childhood abuse and physical health in adulthood. A randomly selected population-based sample, with oversampling to include a one-third subgroup of former child protection cases, completed a structured interview. Questions pertained to childhood exposure to abuse, adult psychological distress, physical health, and health risk behaviors. Previous research using this sample had identified three abuse typologies: emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and polyvictimization (physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect). All three typologies were significantly associated with poorer self-reported physical health. Psychological distress and health risk behaviors partially mediated the relationship between nonabuse, sexual abuse, polyvictimization, and physical health, and fully mediated the relationship between emotional abuse and physical health. The results of this study indicate that health risk behaviors and symptoms of psychological distress could contribute to some of the long-lasting consequences of childhood abuse on adult physical health. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Entropy is a dimensionless quantity that is used for measuring uncertainty about the state of a system but it can also imply physical qualities, where high entropy is synonymous with high disorder. Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of "primary states" is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit "criticality," i.e., the property of being poised at a "critical" point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. Moreover, if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default-mode network (DMN) and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetized state. © 2014 Carhart-Harris, Leech, Hellyer, Shanahan, Feilding, Tagliazucchi, Chialvo and Nutt.

T1  - What can neuroscience tell us about the potential of psychedelics in healthcare? How the Neurophenomenology of psychedelics research could help us to flourish throughout our lives, as well as to enhance our dying
A1  - Mackenzie R. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Health-related psychedelic research should focus on helping us flourish, not just remedying ill-health or addiction. We don't know enough about how psychedelics could enhance human flourishing. Factors promoting health-through-flourishing include finding meaning in life, spiritual practices, comfortable levels of social bonds, emotionally/physically satisfying sex in a long-term monogamous relationship and control over one's daily life. Psychedelic research could find more. Neuroscience anchors psychedelic research into disease and disorder, e.g. addiction, PSTD, migraine, anxiety, pain etc. Neurophenomenological psychedelics research could illuminate relationships between health, ASC/NOSCs and cognitive liberty to promote human flourishing. If we accept the self as an epiphenomenon of subsystems within the brain, we 'know' 'unconsciously', but are not aware of, many things which affect our lives profoundly. These include control over identifying, remembering and forgetting our states of mind and how to move between them. A prerequisite for integrated investigations into ASC/NOSCs is the establishment of a taxonomic knowledge base which lists, categorises and characterises ASC/NOSCs to enable us to choose specific states of mind and move securely among them. Or, in other words, to enable us to exercise our cognitive liberty safely. I believe that human health and flourishing would be enhanced were we able to direct our states of being by consciously choosing them. Given the promise of mindfulness techniques to enhance our health, happiness and spiritual growth, constructing both personal and generic classifications of salient ASC/NOSCs makes sense. Laws need to change. The neuroscience of pleasure, love, spirituality, decision-making, pattern recognition and location of meaning should inform health-enhancing psychedelic research while promoting flourishing through cognitive liberty. As part of cognitive liberty, our end-of-life choices should include how we die. In other words, our idea of the good death should include access to psychedelics. Dying high is increasingly likely to become a popular choice as baby boomers age and place their economic clout behind the reform of end-of-life laws as well as drug laws. Achieving such crucial legal changes depends partly on the ability to produce research to anchor evidence based law and policy. Research into psychedelics, ASC/NOSCs and the neurobiology of the dying process is essential.Copyright © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Background: This report documents the phenomenology of the subjective experiences of 15 healthy psychedelic experienced volunteers who were involved in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study that was designed to image the brain effects of intravenous psilocybin. Methods: The participants underwent a semi-structured interview exploring the effects of psilocybin in the MRI scanner. These interviews were analysed by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The resultant data is ordered in a detailed matrix, and presented in this paper. Results: Nine broad categories of phenomenology were identified in the phenomenological analysis of the experience; perceptual changes including visual, auditory and somatosensory distortions, cognitive changes, changes in mood, effects of memory, spiritual or mystical type experiences, aspects relating to the scanner and research environment, comparisons with other experiences, the intensity and onset of effects, and individual interpretation of the experience. Discussion: This article documents the phenomenology of psilocybin when given in a novel manner (intravenous injection) and setting (an MRI scanner). The findings of the analysis are consistent with previous published work regarding the subjective effects of psilocybin. There is much scope for further research investigating the phenomena identified in this paper.Copyright © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.

T1  - Psychedelics as medicines for substance abuse rehabilitation: Evaluating treatments with LSD, peyote, ibogaine and Ayahuasca
A1  - Winkelman M. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Substances known as psychedelics, hallucinogens and entheogens have been employed in ethnomedical traditions for thousands of years, but after promising uses in the 1950's and 1960's they were largely prohibited in medical treatment and human research starting in the 1970's as part of the fallout from the war on drugs. Nonetheless, there are a number of studies which suggest that these substances have potential applications in the treatment of addictions. While these substances are generally classified as Schedule I, alleging no established medical uses and a high drug abuse potential, there is nonetheless evidence indicating they might be safe and effective tools for short term interventions in addictions treatment. Evidence suggests that the psychedelics have a much greater safety profile than the major addictive drugs, having extremely low levels of mortality, and producing little if any physical dependence. This paper reviews studies evaluating the use of LSD, peyote, ibogaine and ayahuasca in the treatment of dependencies and the possible mechanisms underlying the indications of effectiveness. Evidence suggests that these substances help assist recovery from drug dependency through a variety of therapeutic mechanisms, including a notable "after-glow" effect that in part reflects their action on the serotonin neurotransmitter system. Serotonin has been long recognized as central to the psychedelics' well-known phenomenological, physical, emotional and cognitive dynamics. These serotonin-based dynamics are directly relevant to treatment of addiction because of depressed serotonin levels found in addict populations, as well as the role of serotonin as a neuromodulators affecting many other neurotransmitter systems.Copyright © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Despite suggestive early findings on the therapeutic use of hallucinogens in the treatment of substance use disorders, rigorous follow-up has not been conducted. To determine the safety and feasibility of psilocybin as an adjunct to tobacco smoking cessation treatment we conducted an open-label pilot study administering moderate (20 mg/70 kg) and high (30 mg/70 kg) doses of psilocybin within a structured 15-week smoking cessation treatment protocol. Participants were 15 psychiatrically healthy nicotine-dependent smokers (10 males; mean age of 51 years), with a mean of six previous lifetime quit attempts, and smoking a mean of 19 cigarettes per day for a mean of 31 years at intake. Biomarkers assessing smoking status, and self-report measures of smoking behavior demonstrated that 12 of 15 participants (80%) showed seven-day point prevalence abstinence at 6-month follow-up. The observed smoking cessation rate substantially exceeds rates commonly reported for other behavioral and/or pharmacological therapies (typically <35%). Although the open-label design does not allow for definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of psilocybin, these findings suggest psilocybin may be a potentially efficacious adjunct to current smoking cessation treatment models. The present study illustrates a framework for future research on the efficacy and mechanisms of hallucinogen-facilitated treatment of addiction.Copyright © The Author(s) 2014.

N2  - The study of rapid changes in brain dynamics and functional connectivity (FC) is of increasing interest in neuroimaging. Brain states departing from normal waking consciousness are expected to be accompanied by alterations in the aforementioned dynamics. In particular, the psychedelic experience produced by psilocybin (a substance found in "magic mushrooms") is characterized by unconstrained cognition and profound alterations in the perception of time, space and selfhood. Considering the spontaneous and subjective manifestation of these effects, we hypothesize that neural correlates of the psychedelic experience can be found in the dynamics and variability of spontaneous brain activity fluctuations and connectivity, measurable with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy subjects were scanned before, during and after intravenous infusion of psilocybin and an inert placebo. Blood-Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) temporal variability was assessed computing the variance and total spectral power, resulting in increased signal variability bilaterally in the hippocampi and anterior cingulate cortex. Changes in BOLD signal spectral behavior (including spectral scaling exponents) affected exclusively higher brain systems such as the default mode, executive control, and dorsal attention networks. A novel framework enabled us to track different connectivity states explored by the brain during rest. This approach revealed a wider repertoire of connectivity states post-psilocybin than during control conditions. Together, the present results provide a comprehensive account of the effects of psilocybin on dynamical behavior in the human brain at a macroscopic level and may have implications for our understanding of the unconstrained, hyper-associative quality of consciousness in the psychedelic state.

N2  - We present the case of a 27-year-old man with a background diagnosis of treatment resistant schizophrenia and absent insight who for the last 3 years has been residing in a high support residential setting on approved leave under the Mental Health Act (MHA) 2001. The case demonstrates how this man achieved clinical stability in the community with the assistance of long-term involuntary admission under the MHA 2001, in contrast to the previous years of his illness in which he had suffered multiple relapses of his psychotic illness with ssociated distress, poor self-care and repeated in-patient re-admissions. We discuss the equivalent use of community treatment orders in other jurisdictions and how the judicious use of approved leave under the MHA 2001 may be used as an alternative in Ireland where community treatment orders are not currently available. Method. Case Report. Conclusion. The case report highlights how the use of long-term approved leave under the MHA2001 may be used as alternative in Ireland to mimic CTOs for certain difficult to treat patients with psychotic illness who would benefit from ongoing treatment, but lack capacity to engage in such treatment due to persistent symptoms and lack of insight.

T1  - Psilocybin-occasioned mystical experiences in the treatment of tobacco addiction
A1  - Garcia-Romeu A.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Psilocybin-occasioned mystical experiences have been linked to persisting effects in healthy volunteers including positive changes in behavior, attitudes, and values, and increases in the personality domain of openness. In an open-label pilot-study of psilocybin-facilitated smoking addiction treatment, 15 smokers received 2 or 3 doses of psilocybin in the context of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation. Twelve of 15 participants (80%) demonstrated biologically verified smoking abstinence at 6-month follow-up. Participants who were abstinent at 6 months (n=12) were compared to participants still smoking at 6 months (n=3) on measures of subjective effects of psilocybin. Abstainers scored significantly higher on a measure of psilocybin-occasioned mystical experience. No significant differences in general intensity of drug effects were found between groups, suggesting that mystical-type subjective effects, rather than overall intensity of drug effects, were responsible for smoking cessation. Nine of 15 participants (60%) met criteria for "complete" mystical experience. Smoking cessation outcomes were significantly correlated with measures of mystical experience on session days, as well as retrospective ratings of personal meaning and spiritual significance of psilocybin sessions. These results suggest a mediating role of mystical experience in psychedelic-facilitated addiction treatment.Copyright © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.

T1  - Psilocybin and obsessive compulsive disorder
A1  - Wilcox J.A. 
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder with considerable morbidity and mortality. This condition disables many individuals and is often refractory to treatment. Research suggests that serotonin plays a role in OCD symptom reduction. We present a case of an individual who successfully used psilocybin, a serotonergic agent, to reduce the core symptoms of OCD for several years. Although not endorsing this form of treatment, we feel that the successful use of this agent highlights the role of serotonergic factors in OCD and the need for further, legitimate research into the value of psilocybin in the treatment of anxiety disorders.Copyright © 2014 Journal of Psychoactive Drugs.

N2  - Covering: up to December 2013. Over the past decade, there has been a growing transition in recreational drugs from natural materials (marijuana, hashish, opium), natural products (morphine, cocaine), or their simple derivatives (heroin), to synthetic agents more potent than their natural prototypes, which are sometimes less harmful in the short term, or that combine properties from different classes of recreational prototypes. These agents have been named smart drugs, and have become popular both for personal consumption and for collective intoxication at rave parties. The reasons for this transition are varied, but are mainly regulatory and commercial. New analogues of known illegal intoxicants are invisible to most forensic detection techniques, while the alleged natural status and the lack of avert acute toxicity make them appealing to a wide range of users. On the other hand, the advent of the internet has made possible the quick dispersal of information among users and the on-line purchase of these agents and/or the precursors for their synthesis. Unlike their natural products chemotypes (ephedrine, mescaline, cathinone, psilocybin, THC), most new drugs of abuse are largely unfamiliar to the organic chemistry community as well as to health care providers. To raise awareness of the growing plague of smart drugs we have surveyed, in a medicinal chemistry fashion, their development from natural products leads, their current methods of production, and the role that clandestine home laboratories and underground chemists have played in the surge of popularity of these drugs.

N2  - Objectives: Cluster headache is one of the most debilitating pain syndromes. A significant number of patients are refractory to conventional therapies. The clusterbusters.org medication use survey sought to characterize the effects of both conventional and alternative medications used in cluster headache. Methods: Subjects were recruited from cluster headache websites and headache clinics. The final analysis included responses from 496 participants. The survey was modeled after previously published surveys and was available online. Most responses were chosen from a list, though others were freetexted. Results: Conventional abortive and preventative medications were identified and their efficacies agreed with those previously published. The hallucinogenic agents, psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide, and lysergic acid amide, were equal to or more efficacious than conventional agents at aborting and preventing attacks. These indolamine hallucinogens were also perceived to shorten/abort a period and bring chronic cluster headache into remission more often than most other medications. Conclusion: The findings from the online clusterbusters. org survey provide additional evidence that several indolamine hallucinogens are rated highly effective in treating cluster attacks, shortening/aborting a cluster period, and often reportedly induce remission. These data reinforce the need for further investigation of the effects of these compounds in cluster headache under experimentally controlled settings.

T1  - The path toward making psilocybin available for medical use: New findings and analyses related to abuse potential and safety

N2  - Background: Psilocybin has been used and studied for more than one-half century as a treatment for various mental disorders including anxiety, depression, and substance dependence in the United States and several other countries. Since its regulation as a schedule I (CI) controlled substance under the 1970 United States Controlled Substances Act (CSA), however, there have been severe constraints on its use in research. In brief, schedule I is the CSA placement for drugs that (a) have a high potential for abuse, (b) are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for medical use, and (c) have not been found acceptably safe for use under medical supervision. Clinical research and other research since the 1990s suggests that psilocybin has important medicinal benefits, can be safely administered, and is characterized by a relatively low abuse and physical dependence potential profile compared to schedule II and III opioids, stimulants, and depressants. The potential indication under recent study is severe anxiety/depression secondary to cancer diagnosis in patients who are refractory to standard care options. The therapeutic approach would likely involve no more than two doses to be administered in controlled settings by specially trained staff. This poster will summarize clinical and nonclinical studies relevant to abuse potential evaluation according to the CSA 8 factor assessment tool, including new data and analyses. The poster will also present an evaluation of original data from several completed studies, and preliminary results from ongoing studies that are relevant to evaluation of safety. Methods: Several Phase I and Phase II studies were conducted and are ongoing, including administration of psilocybin at various dose levels to healthy volunteers to evaluate the pharmacodynamics and efficacy in several potential therapeutic applications in people with various psychiatric disorders. Adverse event data across studies were coded using metrics similar to those used in safety and efficacy clinical trials for other CNS drugs. All of the clinical studies were conducted under Investigational New Drug applications and with Institutional Review Board approval at academic medical centers. Doses ranged from 14 mg/70 kg to 30 mg/70 kg, given at intervals of at least one week, usually twice, and never more than three times per volunteer. The test session rooms were supportive therapeutic settings. Trained counselors monitored events, recorded data, and offered reassurance. Several of the studies included double-blind comparisons to placebo and one study included 40 mg/70 mg methylphenidate as a comparator drug. More than 200 volunteers have been exposed to at least one, and more typically to two or three doses of psilocybin in the Heffter Research Institute collaborative studies. Safety data evaluations are ongoing and data from many/most of these exposures will be presented. Results: Results that have been collected (and in some cases presented or published at the time this abstract was developed) included the following: (1) Psilocybin at all doses was generally well tolerated, resulting in no serious adverse events requiring emergency interventions, (2) Psilocybin did not produce effects that were readily characterized as either sedating or stimulating but rather induced a unique profile of effects characterized by perceptual changes (e.g. visual illusions), labile mood (e.g. feelings of transcendence, grief, joy, and/or anxiety), and cognitive changes (e.g. a sense of meaning or insight). (3) Follow-up evaluations at one to 14 months revealed lasting effects, with psilocybin sessions generally described in positive terms as among the most meaningful events of the person's lifetime, with resulting increases in spirituality and quality of life indicating improvements that were persistent; (4) initial findings in cancer patients suggest reductions in anxiety and depression symptoms. A preliminary evaluation of the eight factors of the CSA for the purpose of developing a drug scheduling recommendation included analysis of chemistry, pharmacology, preclinical data, epidemiology, and other clinical evidence. The analysis supports a plausible recommendation for CSA regulation as a schedule IV drug. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings suggest potential therapeutic efficacy for symptoms of anxiety and depression secondary to cancer diagnosis in patients refractory to standard care. Medical risks and side-effects were generally mild and manageable by study staff. The evidence does not suggest a high risk of abuse or dependence. A potential application for approval would include a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) that would likely restrict distribution directly to the health care providers (HCPs), limit dosing, require certification that HCPs had been appropriately trained, and would include appropriate evaluation and follow-up of all patients.

T1  - Serotonergic modulation of emotion processing by the mixed 5-HT1A/2A receptor agonist psilocybin reduces amygdala activation to negative stimuli-a pharmacological fMRI study

N2  - Purpose: There is growing evidence supporting the notion that the serotonin (5-HT) agonist psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N,Ndimethyltryptamine), the main psychoactive principle of 'magic mushrooms', may reduce neural responses to negative stimuli and induce long-lasting positive mood and attitudes [1]. Such a profound effect on emotion and mood processes might underlie the putative antidepressant properties of psilocybin, as it has repeatedly been shown that a critical mechanism for antidepressant efficacy may be an effect which counteracts negative mood states and limbic hyperactivity in response to negative stimuli in patients with major depression. A recent clinical study [2] in patients with depression and anxiety related to advanced-stage cancer supports this notion: a single dose of psilocybin significantly decreased anxiety and increased positive mood for up to 6 months. However, the neurobiological mechanisms by which psilocybin influences emotion processing remain poorly understood. In particular, it is still unclear whether psilocybin modulates the activity of the amygdala, a region that plays a crucial role in the neural effects of antidepressants, during emotion processing, and whether any psilocybin-induced effect on amygdala activity during emotion processing is related to changes in mood state. Methods: In this study, the acute effects of low-dose psilocybin (0.16 mg/kg) on amygdala activation were measured using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotion processing task and in combination with assessment of mood changes. 25 healthy subjects (16 males, mean age 24.2+/-3.42 years) were included in the study. The study followed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Subjects received either placebo or 0.16 mg/kg oral psilocybin at two separate imaging sessions 2 weeks apart. During scanning, subjects performed an established amygdala reactivity task, using picture stimuli from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Mood changes were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: Both whole-brain voxel-wise and region of interest (ROI)-based analyses showed that right-amygdala activation in response to negative stimuli was significantly lower after psilocybin administration than after placebo administration (psilocybin mean+/-SD: 0.36+/-0.28; placebo: 0.58+/-0.36; p<0.001). Further, psilocybin significantly increased positive mood (p = 0.001), but not anxiety (p = 0.37), and this effect was correlated to psilocybininduced decrease of amygdala reactivity (r = -0.46, p<0.05). Conclusions: Results show that acute administration of lowdose psilocybin decrease amygdala reactivity to negative pictures. Notably, this effect was correlated with psilocybin-induced increase in positive mood. These findings confirm and extend previous evidence that 5-HT1A/2A receptor stimulation may induce positive mood states and decrease neural responses to negative stimuli. In addition, this study demonstrates that the amygdala, a key component within limbic structures implicated in emotion processing, may be an important neural target underlying the hypothesized antidepressant properties of psilocybin.

N2  - PURPOSE: Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy is currently being studied as method to help alleviate cancer related existential anxiety in several academic settings in the United States (New York University School of Medicine, Johns- Hopkins University). The authors served as co-therapists in the NYU Cancer Anxiety Psilocybin project, working with a patient with metastatic breast cancer who suffered from marked passivity, accompanied by mixed anxiety and depression symptoms. We will present a rationale for this approach, several vignettes from the eleven-session treatment and the benefits derived from this type of intervention. METHODS: GS is a 70 year-old married woman with one adopted daughter. She has a 12-year history of breast cancer, with multiple recurrences. The decreasing length of time between each recurrence led to a deep fearfulness and passivity regarding her ongoing cancer treatment. After a thorough clinical engagement, our therapy functioned to prepare her for a single, daylong meditative session guided by us with psilocybin, a serotonergichallucinogen, known to occasion mystical-type experiences with personal meaning and spiritual significance. Therapy sessions followed, in which we explored how her remarkably intense experience with the psilocybin affected her. We will present clinical material from her sessions, including our efforts to integrate her psilocybin experience with her presenting symptoms and family dynamics. RESULTS: There were notable shifts in self-identity, recovery of lost and abandoned strengths, and changes in her narratives regarding the psychological effects of cancer treatment in her life. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available interventions for cancer related existential anxiety are limited in both scope and effectiveness. We will describe an innovative paradigm for treatment, one that has a medication-assisted spiritual experience at its core. We will discuss clinical material, our therapeutic approach to this type of work and its impact on our patient's quality of life. Specifically, we will highlight the reduction in her anxiety and passivity, affective stabilization and the recovery of a sense of meaning and purpose in life. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: Currently available interventions for cancer related existential anxiety are limited in both scope and effectiveness.We will describe an innovative paradigm for treatment, one that has amedication-assisted spiritual experience at its core. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: We will discuss clinical material, our therapeutic approach to this type of work and its impact on our patient's quality of life. Specifically, we will highlight the reduction in her anxiety and passivity, affective stabilization and the recovery of a sense of meaning and purpose in life.

N2  - Background: Psilocybin is a potent hallucinogen found in several species of mushrooms. Upon ingestion, it is rapidly metabolized to psilocin. Psilocin binds with high affinity to serotonin receptors and produces an altered mental state characterized by hallucinations and synthesias. There is little literature on the effects of psilocybin exposure in young pediatric patients. We report a case of an acutely altered 10 year old boy who was found to have high levels of psilocin in his serum. Case Report: A 10 year-old boy presented with altered mental status. Per family, he was in his normal state of health prior to going to a barbeque at an apartment complex. Afterwards, he was unable to say his name or walk straight. There was no evidence of trauma. No ingestion was witnessed. His vital signs were within normal limits for his age. His physical exam was significant for mydriasis without nystagmus. He moved all extremities but would not follow commands. No hyperreflexia or clonus was noted. He would not speak but appeared to be hallucinating as he intermittently reached for things in the air and giggled inappropriately. He was given intramuscular ketamine (3mg/kg) to obtain a head CT and labs. They were normal, including a negative urine drug immunoassay screen and serum ethanol level. He was admitted for observation. Within 12 hours he had returned to his baseline mental status and was discharged. His serum from admission was sent for comprehensive screening using liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF/MS) (Agilent LC 1260- TOF/MS 6230). Psilocin was detected at 45 ng/mL. Metabolites of psilocin, 4-hydroxytryptophol and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, and ketamine were also detected. Further investigation could not identify the source of the psilocin. The ketamine result was attributed to his emergency department workup. Case Discussion: Psilocybin and psilocin were isolated and identified by Albert Hofmann in 1958. Psilocin is the active, primary metabolite of psilocybin. Studies indicate that when taking orally, psilocybin is rapidly and almost completely converted to psilocin. Psilocin has its clinical effects by binding to 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptor. Though poorly studied, psilocin levels of 4 - 6 ng/mL are described to cause psychotic symptoms in adults. There are no other reports of laboratory confirmed psilocin exposures in a patient this young. This patient's level is among the highest reported in the medical literature and makes it likely his symptoms were due to psilocin. Conclusion: While uncommon, psilocin may cause significant symptoms in apediatric patient. It should be considered in the evaluation of the acutely altered child, especially if hallucinations are present.

N2  - Background : Ayahuasca is a tea used in South America for medical and sacramental purposes. In the last decade, there have been reports of use in North America. N,N-dimethyltyptamine (DMT) is a tryptophan derivative that produces hallucinogenic effects and is often a component of Ayahuasca. This co-administration is beneficial to the user because DMT, administered orally, undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism by monoamine oxidases (MAO) and Ayahuasca is a MAO inhibitor. Therefore, the concentration of DMT in the systemic circulation is increased. Case Report : A 25 year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) under mental health arrest for acting strangely. At 11:00 the patient reportedly ingested an Ayahuasca tea he purchased from the internet. He became agitated and was hallucinating and "fighting with a cat in his front yard," which prompted neighbors to call police. He had broken several windows, was bleeding, and when police arrived at 16:00 he was tasered due to severe agitation. Upon presentation to the ED, he was not agitated but still required restraints. He endorsed hallucinations but was able to describe the ingestion. He did not recall breaking windows, fighting with a cat or the police arriving. He endorsed previous Ayahuasca, psilocybin and LSD use. On exam he had multiple lacerations to the back, chest, face and all extremities. Pupils were dilated to 4 - 5 mm. He had increased tone with several beats of clonus, 3 + patella reflexes but no overt rigidity. He was flushed but not diaphoretic. Admission vitals were: temperature 37.2 degree C, heart rate 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, blood pressure 116/71 mmHg. He had leukocytosis (20,000/ mu L) and mild rhabdomyolysis (creatinine kinase 895 units/L). Urine drug screen was positive for amphetamines (confirmation negative). A urine tryptamine screen confirmed dimethyltryptamine present at DMT screen from arrival and subsequently resulted > 2000 ng/mL. The patient was given intravenous fluids, did not require pharmacologic therapy and was discharged three days later. Case Discussion : Our patient experienced hallucinations and amnesia to some events following DMT ingestion augmented by Ayahuasca. He developed rhabdomyolysis likely from a mild serotonin syndrome. Symptoms from his intoxication dissipated 6 - 7 hours from the time of ingestion. He did not require treatment with benzodiazepines and only received fluid resuscitation. Conclusion : Acute DMT ingestion may result in agitation, delirium and hallucinogenic effects as well as serotonin syndrome. Management of the patient's symptoms with intravenous fluids and benzodiazepines, when necessary, should be utilized to prevent sequelae.

N2  - Purpose: Several lines of evidence suggest that classic hallucinogens may have clinically relevant effects in alcohol and drug addiction. A meta-analysis of controlled trials of LSD for alcoholismdemonstrated consistent benefits persisting to 6 months after treatment. Although recent studies have investigated the effects of psilocybin in various populations, there have been no studies on the efficacy of psilocybin for alcohol dependence. We conducted an open-label pilot study designed to establish an appropriate dose range for use of psilocybin in alcohol dependent participants, demonstrate the feasibility of the integrated behavioral/pharmacologic intervention, and provide preliminary outcome and safety data. Methods: Participants were 10 volunteers (4 women and 6 men) with DSM-IV alcohol dependence. They received 12 weekly psychosocial treatment sessions consisting of Motivational Enhancement Therapy as well as preparation for and debriefing from the psilocybin administration sessions. Psilocybin was administered at weeks 4 and 8. In the first session all participants received a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. Six participants received a dose of 0.4 mg/kg in the second session, one received 0.3 mg/kg, and three did not receive a second session. Results: Participants' responses to psilocybin were qualitatively similar to those described in other populations, but there was considerable variation among participants in self-reported intensity of subjective experience. There were no significant treatment-related adverse events. Abstinence did not increase significantly in the firstmonth of treatment (when participants had not yet received psilocybin), but increased significantly during the second and third months of treatment (p<0.05). There were strong correlations (r>0.8) between the intensity and mystical quality of the experience in the first psilocybin session (at 4 weeks) and increased abstinence during weeks 5-8. The intensity of the week 4 experience was also highly correlated with decreases in craving and increases in abstinence self-efficacy during week 5. Conclusion: Participants in this open-label pilot study tolerated psilocybin well and drank less following treatment. The strength of the subjective experience with psilocybin was a strong predictor of improvement in drinking behavior as well as craving and self efficacy, suggesting possiblemechanisms of action. Controlled trials will be necessary to provide stronger evidence of efficacy andmechanisms.

N2  - Objective: Party drug consumption is a growing problem in Denmark. Often these drugs are taken in combination. We therefore set out to describe the consumption pattern of party drugs through experiences from the Danish Poison Information Centre (DPIC). Methods: Between January 2006 and May 2013, DPIC received 112,000 telephone contacts. We searched the DPIC database for contacts which involved substances such as amphetamine, ecstasy, ketamine, cocaine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, mescaline, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Results: During the study period, DPIC had 3360 contacts which involved party drugs, representing a total of 3102 poisonings. Party drug consumption was clearly a weekend phenomenon-half of the contacts were on Saturdays and Sundays (P < 0.0001). Table 1 shows the most commonly used drugs and how these were combined: amphetamines or ecstasy were used in 56% of the party drug poisonings, and were often combined with cocaine, cannabis, or benzodiazepines. In 4% of the poisonings, patients were co-medicated with antipsychotics or antidepressants. However, combinations with other kinds of prescription drugs were negligible. Conclusion: Combining different party drugs and psychopharmacological prescriptions is common. The majority of these combinations hold the potential for severe pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions. However, the volume of scientific literature in the field is sparse. Despite the limitations associated with retrospective data from PICs, our data emphasize the importance of evaluating drug-drug interactions for risk assessment. (Table presented).

N2  - Introduction: Serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin and its active metabolite psilocin are nowadays given a lot of attention in the scientific community as a research tool for modeling psychosis. First experiments assessing brain activity after psilocybin administration in humans using PET and fMRI found contradictory results [1,2]. More recently, a study measuring directly the neuronal activity using MEG confirmed massive inhibition of brain activity [3]. The aim of our animal study was to assess psilocin-induced changes in quantitative EEG (QEEG) in context of behavioral activity of rats and to explore the role of different serotonergic receptors in psilocin action. An effect of atypical antipsychotic clozapine on changes induced by psilocin was also evaluated. Methods: The substances used were: Psilocin (0.25, 1 and 4 mg/kg s.c.), 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 maleate (1 mg/kg s.c.), 5-HT2A antagonist MDL-100907 tartarate (0.5 mg/kg s.c.), 5-HT2C antagonist SB-242084 (1 mg/kg s.c.) and clozapine 5 mg/kg i.p. For EEG experiments, rats were stereotactically implanted under isoflurane anesthesia with 12 active electrodes on the surface of frontal, parietal and temporal cortex. EEG was recorded (Brainscope EADS-221 amplifier, Unimedis, Czech Republic) in freely moving rats after one week recovery from surgery. EEG power spectra (local synchronization) and coherence (long projections) were subsequently analyzed in Neuroguide Deluxe v.2.6 comparing the drug effect to the baseline record. To avoid moving artifacts and effects of behavior on EEG, only EEG traces corresponding to behavioral inactivity were included in the analysis. The impact of substances on EEG signal was evaluated using a pair T-test. The significance level was estab-lished as p<0.05. Locomotor activity was assessed in open field test (EthoVision Color Pro v. 3.1.1, Noldus, Netherlands). For behavioral experiments a twoway ANOVA with Bonferroni correction was performed. Results: Psilocin induced dose-dependent decrease in locomotor activity and it generally decreased both EEG absolute spectral power (most prominently in theta band) and EEG coherences (in lower frequencies both inter- and intra-hemispherical, in higher frequencies only inter-hemispherical). Inhibition of locomotion induced by psilocin was abolished byWAY100635 and SB242084, but MDL100907 and clozapine did not have any effect. The changes in spectral power induced by psilocin were normalized by 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A antagonists. WAY100635 normalized partially EEG coherences and even induced discrete increases. MDL100907 normalized coherences predominantly in delta band. SB242084 did not affect psilocin-induced pattern of QEEG. Clozapine normalized partially both relative spectral power and EEG coherences. Conclusions: Our results showed that psilocin changed normal behavioral pattern of rats and decreased locomotor activity probably via 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors. The psilocin-induced changes in QEEG, mediated at least partially by 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, are in accordance with the concept of psychosis as a disconnection syndrome. Clozapine was less effective in normalization of these changes than 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A antagonists. Surprisingly, the 5-HT1A antagonist had the strongest effect in general, even though psilocin had higher affinity on 5-HT2C and 5-HT2A receptors. .

T1  - Serotonergic hyperactivity as a potential factor in developmental, acquired and drug-induced synesthesia
A1  - Brogaard B. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Though synesthesia research has seen a huge growth in recent decades, and tremendous progress has been made in terms of understanding the mechanism and cause of synesthesia, we are still left mostly in the dark when it comes to the mechanistic commonalities (if any) among developmental, acquired and drug-induced synesthesia. We know that many forms of synesthesia involve aberrant structural or functional brain connectivity. Proposed mechanisms include direct projection and disinhibited feedback mechanisms, in which information from two otherwise structurally or functionally separate brain regions mix. We also know that synesthesia sometimes runs in families. However, it is unclear what causes its onset. Studies of psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin, LSD and mescaline, reveal that exposure to these drugs can induce synesthesia. One neurotransmitter suspected to be central to the perceptual changes is serotonin. Excessive serotonin in the brain may cause many of the characteristics of psychedelic intoxication. Excessive serotonin levels may also play a role in synesthesia acquired after brain injury. In brain injury sudden cell death floods local brain regions with serotonin and glutamate. This neurotransmitter flooding could perhaps result in unusual feature binding. Finally, developmental synesthesia that occurs in individuals with autism may be a result of alterations in the serotonergic system, leading to a blockage of regular gating mechanisms. I conclude on these grounds that one commonality among at least some cases of acquired, developmental and drug-induced synesthesia may be the presence of excessive levels of serotonin, which increases the excitability and connectedness of sensory brain regions. © 2013 Brogaard.

N2  - Psilocybin is a classic psychedelic and a candidate drug model of psychosis. This study measured the effects of psilocybin on resting-state network and thalamocortical functional connectivity (FC) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy volunteers received intravenous infusions of psilocybin and placebo in 2 task-free resting-state scans. Primary analyses focused on changes in FC between the default-mode- (DMN) and task-positive network (TPN). Spontaneous activity in the DMN is orthogonal to spontaneous activity in the TPN, and it is well known that these networks support very different functions (ie, the DMN supports introspection, whereas the TPN supports externally focused attention). Here, independent components and seed-based FC analyses revealed increased DMN-TPN FC and so decreased DMN-TPN orthogonality after psilocybin. Increased DMN-TPN FC has been found in psychosis and meditatory states, which share some phenomenological similarities with the psychedelic state. Increased DMN-TPN FC has also been observed in sedation, as has decreased thalamocortical FC, but here we found preserved thalamocortical FC after psilocybin. Thus, we propose that thalamocortical FC may be related to arousal, whereas DMN-TPN FC is related to the separateness of internally and externally focused states. We suggest that this orthogonality is compromised in early psychosis, explaining similarities between its phenomenology and that of the psychedelic state and supporting the utility of psilocybin as a model of early psychosis. © 2012 The Author.

N2  - Objectives: Over the last century, studies have shown that sleep provides numerous benefits and improves quality of life. However, modern life often subjects inhabitants of large cities to chronic lack of sleep due to either social or financial reasons. Simultaneously, sleep loss is frequently associated with the use of illicit drugs to obtain stimulant and pleasurable effects. This review presents a general overview of global production of preclinical studies on drugs of abuse and sleep. Methods: To carry out this survey, specific keywords were searched in the Web of Science database. The drugs selected for this review were based on the most abused drugs described by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNO-DC) and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). Results: The results show an increase in studies examining these drugs and sleep. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) had the highest percentage of preclinical sleep studies than the other drugs due to its sleep-inducing properties. On the other hand, no preclinical sleep studies were found for other drugs such as ayahuasca, psilocybin, desomorphine, and benzodifuranyls. Conclusion: The results indicate a growing number of publications examining sleep-inducing drugs in preclinical sleep research and also revealed a great expansion in the study with drugs of abuse.

N2  - Many psychoactive drugs are used recreationally, particularly by young people. This use and its perceived dangers have led to many different classes of drugs being banned under national laws and international conventions. Indeed, the possession of cannabis, 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA; also known as ecstasy) and psychedelics is stringently regulated. An important and unfortunate outcome of the controls placed on these and other psychoactive drugs is that they make research into their mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic uses-for example, in depression and post-traumatic stress disorder-difficult and in many cases almost impossible. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

T1  - Studying the effects of classic hallucinogens in the treatment of alcoholism: Rationale, methodology, and current research with psilocybin
A1  - Bogenschutz M.P. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Recent developments in the study of classic hallucinogens, combined with a re-appraisal of the older literature, have led to a renewal of interest in possible therapeutic applications for these drugs, notably their application in the treatment of addictions. This article will first provide a brief review of the research literature providing direct and indirect support for the possible therapeutic effects of classic hallucinogens such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the treatment of addictions. Having provided a rationale for clinical investigation in this area, we discuss design issues in clinical trials using classic hallucinogens, some of which are unique to this class of drug. We then discuss the current status of this field of research and design considerations in future randomized trials. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

T1  - Peak Experiences of Psilocybin Users and Non-Users
A1  - Cummins C.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Maslow (1970) defined peak experiences as the most wonderful experiences of a person's life, which may include a sense of awe, well-being, or transcendence. Furthermore, recent research has suggested that psilocybin can produce experiences subjectively rated as uniquely meaningful and significant (Griffiths et al. 2006). It is therefore possible that psilocybin may facilitate or change the nature of peak experiences in users compared to non-users. This study was designed to compare the peak experiences of psilocybin users and non-users, to evaluate the frequency of peak experiences while under the influence of psilocybin, and to assess the perceived degree of alteration of consciousness during these experiences. Participants were recruited through convenience and snowball sampling from undergraduate classes and at a musical event. Participants were divided into three groups, those who reported a peak experience while under the influence of psilocybin (psilocybin peak experience: PPE), participants who had used psilocybin but reported their peak experiences did not occur while they were under the influence of psilocybin (non-psilocybin peak experience: NPPE), and participants who had never used psilocybin (non-user: NU). A total of 101 participants were asked to think about their peak experiences and complete a measure evaluating the degree of alteration of consciousness during that experience. Results indicated that 47% of psilocybin users reported their peak experience occurred while using psilocybin. In addition, there were significant differences among the three groups on all dimensions of alteration of consciousness. Future research is necessary to identify factors that influence the peak experiences of psilocybin users in naturalistic settings and contribute to the different characteristics of peak experiences of psilocybin users and non-users. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

T1  - Animal models of serotonergic psychedelics
A1  - Hanks J.B.
A1  - Gonzalez-Maeso J. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - The serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is the major target of psychedelic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline, and psilocybin. Serotonergic psychedelics induce profound effects on cognition, emotion, and sensory processing that often seem uniquely human. This raises questions about the validity of animal models of psychedelic drug action. Nonetheless, recent findings suggest behavioral abnormalities elicited by psychedelics in rodents that predict such effects in humans. Here we review the behavioral effects induced by psychedelic drugs in rodent models, discuss the translational potential of these findings, and define areas where further research is needed to better understand the molecular mechanisms and neuronal circuits underlying their neuropsychological effects. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

N2  - Background: Recreational usage and attitudes toward psilocybin-containing hallucinogenic mushrooms among college students are seldom explored. Methods: We surveyed 882 randomly selected undergraduates at Skidmore College in upstate New York and quantified whether participants had ever used psilocybin mushrooms, their attitudes toward the drug, and polydrug use. Results: There were 409 responses and 29.5% of the sample reported psilocybin use. Among users, the mean number of times they reported using mushrooms was 3.4 (mode. =1). The top factors cited that influenced their decisions to try hallucinogenic mushrooms for the first time were 'curiosity', 'to achieve a mystical experience', and 'introspection'. Users and non-users had significantly different perceptions of mushrooms: non-users were more likely to say that hallucinogenic mushrooms were addictive and had the potential for abuse than users. Users did not believe that psilocybin negatively impacts their academics, mental health, or physical health, while non-users did. Both users and non-users of psilocybin reported high life-time use of alcohol (97% vs 96%, respectively), marijuana (98% vs 73%, respectively) and tobacco (82% vs 54%, respectively). Psilocybin users were significantly more likely to use other drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy, opiates, non-prescribed prescription drugs, opiates, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) than non-users of psilocybin. Conclusion: This study uncovers important insights into hallucinogenic mushroom use by college students. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Malignant catatonia is an unusual and highly fatal neuropsychiatric condition which can present with clinical and biochemical manifestations similar to those of pheochromocytoma. Differentiating between the two diseases is essential as management options greatly diverge. We describe a case of malignant catatonia in a 20-year-old male who presented with concurrent psychotic symptoms and autonomic instability, with markedly increased 24-hour urinary levels of norepinephrine at 1752 nmol/day (normal, 89-470 nmol/day), epinephrine at 1045 nmol/day (normal, <160 nmol/day), and dopamine at 7.9 mol/day (normal, 0.4-3.3 mol/day). The patient was treated with multiple sessions of electroconvulsive therapy, which led to complete clinical resolution. Repeat urine collections within weeks of this presenting event revealed normalization or near normalization of his catecholamine and metanephrine levels. Malignant catatonia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the hypercatecholamine state, particularly in a patient who also exhibits concurrent catatonic features. © 2013 Sophia Wong et al.

N2  - Accidents involving ingestion of parts of plants in the home or in the outdoor setting are a typical issue in children, particularly toddlers. Consultations for plant poisoning have accounted for 10% to 11% of the total volume for many years. In children up to 15 years of age, plants as a reason for consultation account for 18%, in older patients they constitute 3%. House plants are particularly associated with leaf ingestion, garden plants with fruit or flower ingestion. Teenagers abuse Jimson weed seeds or, less frequently, small Psilocybin mushrooms for their hallucinogenic effects. Mushrooms are a separate, small, but much feared chapter of child poisoning. If a mushroom meal containing a poisonous mushroom is prepared and eaten, the youngest diner is at risk for the most severe poisoning symptoms. Since mushrooms are not a significant source of nutrients and are difficult to digest for children, it makes sense to leave them out of the diet of preschoolers.

T1  - Fungal hallucinogens psilocin, ibotenic acid, and muscimol: Analytical methods and biologic activities
A1  - Stebelska K. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Psychoactive drugs of fungal origin, psilocin, ibotenic acid, and muscimol among them have been proposed for recreational use and popularized since the 1960s, XX century. Despite their well-documented neurotoxicity, they reached reputation of being safe and nonaddictive. Scientific efforts to find any medical application for these hallucinogens in psychiatry, psychotherapy, and even for religious rituals support are highly controversial. Even if they show any healing potential, their usage in psychotherapy is in some cases inadequate and may additionally harm seriously suffering patients. Hallucinogens are thought to reduce cognitive functions. However, in case of indolealkylamines, such as psilocin, some recent findings suggest their ability to improve perception and mental skills, what would motivate the consumption of "magic mushrooms." The present article offers an opportunity to find out what are the main symptoms of intoxication with mushrooms containing psilocybin/psilocin, muscimol, and ibotenic acid. The progress in analytical methods for detection of them in fungal material, food, and body fluids is reviewed. Findings on the mechanisms of their biologic activity are summarized. Additionally, therapeutic potential of these fungal psychoactive compounds and health risk associated with their abuse are discussed. Copyright © 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - The mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the auditory event-related potential has become a valuable tool in cognitive neuroscience. Its reduced size in persons with schizophrenia is of unknown origin but theories proposed include links to problems in experience-dependent plasticity reliant on N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptors. In this review we address the utility of this tool in revealing the nature and time course of problems in perceptual inference in this illness together with its potential for use in translational research testing animal models of schizophrenia-related phenotypes. Specifically, we review the reasons for interest in MMN in schizophrenia, issues pertaining to the measurement of MMN, its use as a vulnerability index for the development of schizophrenia, the pharmacological sensitivity of MMN and the progress in developing animal models of MMN. Within this process we highlight the challenges posed by knowledge gaps pertaining to the tool and the pharmacology of the underlying system. © 2013 Todd, Harms, Schall and Michie.

N2  - Psilocybin is a substance of natural origin, occurring in hallucinogenic mushrooms (most common in the Psilocybe family). After its synthesis in 1958 research began on its psychoactive properties, particularly strong effects on visual perception and spatial orientation. Due to the very broad spectrum of psilocybin effects research began on the different ranges of its actions - including the effect on physiological processes (such as eye saccada movements). Neuro-imaging and neurophysiological research (positron emission tomography - PET and electroencephalography - EEG), indicate a change in the rate of metabolism of the brain and desync cerebral hemispheres. Experimental studies show the changes in visual perception and distortion from psilocybin in the handwriting style of patients examined. There are widely described subjective experiences reported by the subjects. There are also efforts to apply testing via questionnaire on people under the influence of psilocybin, in the context of the similarity of psilocybin-induced state to the initial stages of schizophrenia, as well as research aimed at creating an 'artificial' model of the disease.

T1  - Activation of serotonin 2A receptors underlies the psilocybin-induced effects on alpha oscillations, N170 visual-evoked potentials, and visual hallucinations

N2  - Visual illusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of serotonergic hallucinogen-induced altered states of consciousness. Although the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin activates multiple serotonin (5-HT) receptors, recent evidence suggests that activation of 5-HT2A receptors may lead to the formation of visual hallucinations by increasing cortical excitability and altering visual-evoked cortical responses. To address this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of psilocybin (215 mug/kg vs placebo) on both alpha oscillations that regulate cortical excitability and early visual-evoked P1 and N170 potentials in healthy human subjects. To further disentangle the specific contributions of 5-HT2A receptors, subjects were additionally pretreated with the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (50 mg vs placebo). We found that psilocybin strongly decreased prestimulus parieto-occipital alpha power values, thus precluding a subsequent stimulus-induced alpha power decrease. Furthermore, psilocybin strongly decreased N170 potentials associated with the appearance of visual perceptual alterations, including visual hallucinations. All of these effects were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin, indicating that activation of 5-HT2A receptors by psilocybin profoundly modulates the neurophysiological and phenomenological indices of visual processing. Specifically, activation of 5-HT2A receptors may induce a processing mode in which stimulus-driven cortical excitation is overwhelmed by spontaneous neuronal excitation through the modulation of alpha oscillations. Furthermore, the observed reduction of N170 visual-evoked potentials may be a key mechanism underlying 5-HT2A receptor-mediated visual hallucinations. This change in N170 potentials may be important not only for psilocybin-induced states but also for understanding acute hallucinatory states seen in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. © 2013 the authors.

N2  - Mushroom-forming fungi produce a wide array of toxic alkaloids. However, evolutionary analyses aimed at exploring the evolution of muscarine, a toxin that stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, and psilocybin, a hallucinogen, have never been performed. The known taxonomic distribution of muscarine within the Inocybaceae is limited, based only on assays of species from temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. Here, we present a review of muscarine and psilocybin assays performed on species of Inocybaceae during the last fifty years. To supplement these results, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to determine whether muscarine was present in 30 new samples of Inocybaceae, the majority of which have not been previously assayed or that originated from either the tropics or temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. Our main objective is to test the hypothesis that the presence of muscarine is a shared ancestral feature of the Inocybaceae. In addition, we also test whether species of Inocyabceae that produce psilocybin are monophyletic. Our findings suggest otherwise. Muscarine has evolved independently on several occasions, together with several losses. We also detect at least two independent transitions of muscarine-free lineages to psilocybin-producing states. Although not ancestral for the family as a whole, muscarine is a shared derived trait for an inclusive clade containing three of the seven major lineages of Inocybaceae (the Inocybe, Nothocybe, and Pseudosperma clades), the common ancestor of which may have evolved ca. 60 million years ago. Thus, muscarine represents a conserved trait followed by several recent losses. Transitions to psilocybin from muscarine-producing ancestors occurred more recently between 10-20 million years ago after muscarine loss in two separate lineages. Statistical analyses firmly reject a single origin of muscarine-producing taxa. © 2013 Kosentka et al.

N2  - Rationale: Both glutamate and serotonin (5-HT) play a key role in the pathophysiology of emotional biases. Recent studies indicate that the glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine and the 5-HT receptor agonist psilocybin are implicated in emotion processing. However, as yet, no study has systematically compared their contribution to emotional biases. Objectives: This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) and signal detection theory to compare the effects of the NMDA (via S-ketamine) and 5-HT (via psilocybin) receptor system on non-conscious or conscious emotional face processing biases. Methods: S-ketamine or psilocybin was administrated to two groups of healthy subjects in a double-blind within-subject placebo-controlled design. We behaviorally assessed objective thresholds for non-conscious discrimination in all drug conditions. Electrophysiological responses to fearful, happy, and neutral faces were subsequently recorded with the face-specific P100 and N170 ERP. Results: Both S-ketamine and psilocybin impaired the encoding of fearful faces as expressed by a reduced N170 over parieto-occipital brain regions. In contrast, while S-ketamine also impaired the encoding of happy facial expressions, psilocybin had no effect on the N170 in response to happy faces. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the NMDA and 5-HT receptor systems differentially contribute to the structural encoding of emotional face expressions as expressed by the N170. These findings suggest that the assessment of early visual evoked responses might allow detecting pharmacologically induced changes in emotional processing biases and thus provides a framework to study the pathophysiology of dysfunctional emotional biases. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - This study aimed to investigate the relationship between navigational strategies and the use of abused substances in a sample of healthy young adults. Navigational strategies were assessed with the 4-on-8 virtual maze (4/8VM), a task previously shown to dissociate between hippocampal-dependent spatial navigational strategies and caudate nucleus-dependent stimulus-response navigational strategies. Spatial strategies involve learning the spatial relationships between the landmarks in an environment, while response learning strategies involve learning a rigid set of stimulus-response type associations, e.g., see the tree, turn left. We have shown that spatial learners have increased gray matter and fMRI activity in the hippocampus compared with response learners, while response learners have increased gray matter and fMRI activity in the caudate nucleus. We were interested in the prevalence of use of substances of abuse in spatial and response learners because of the evidence that people who score high on traits such as novelty seeking, sensation seeking, reward seeking, and impulsivity, are more cue-responsive and more likely to use substances of abuse. Since response learners show increased activity and gray matter in the caudate nucleus of the striatum, which is a brain area involved in addiction, we hypothesized that response learners would have a greater use of abused substances than spatial learners. Fifty-five young adults were tested on the 4/8VM and completed a time-line follow-back assessment of drug and alcohol use. We found that response learners had smoked a significantly greater number of cigarettes in their lifetime than spatial learners, were more likely to have used cannabis, and had double the lifetime alcohol consumption. We discuss the possible relationship between substance abuse and response strategies as well as the implications for the hippocampus, risks of neurological and psychiatric disorders, and healthy cognition. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - What is known and Objective Individuals who abuse drugs usually use more than one substance. Toxic consequences of single and multi-drug use are well documented in the Treatment Episodes Data Set that lists drug combinations that result in hospital admissions. Using this list as a guide, we focused our attention on combinations that result in the most hospital admissions and searched the PubMed database with the objective of determining the number of such publications and, in particular, those that used the term synergism in their titles or abstracts. Comment Using the search criteria produced an extensive list of published articles. However, a further intersection of the search terms with the term isobole revealed a surprisingly small number of literature reports. What is new and Conclusion Because the method of isoboles is the most common quantitative method for distinguishing between drug synergism and simple additivity, the small number of investigations that actually employed this quantification suggests that the term synergism is not properly documented in describing the toxicity among abused substances. The possible reasons for this lack of quantification may be related to a misunderstanding of the modelling equations. To help rectify this possible hurdle to understanding and clinical utility, the theory and modelling are discussed here. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Hallucinogenic drugs, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline and psilocybin, alter perception and cognitive processes. All hallucinogenic drugs have in common a high affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Metabotropic glutamate 2/3 (mGlu2/3) receptor ligands show efficacy in modulating the cellular and behavioral responses induced by hallucinogenic drugs. Here, we explored the effect of chronic treatment with the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist 2S-2-amino-2-(1S,2S-2-carboxycyclopropan-1-yl)-3-(xanth-9-yl)-propionic acid (LY341495) on the hallucinogenic-like effects induced by LSD (0.24mg/kg). Mice were chronically (21 days) treated with LY341495 (1.5mg/kg), or vehicle, and experiments were carried out one day after the last injection. Chronic treatment with LY341495 down-regulated [3H]ketanserin binding in somatosensory cortex of wild-type, but not mGlu2 knockout (KO), mice. Head-twitch behavior, and expression of c-fos, egr-1 and egr-2, which are responses induced by hallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonists, were found to be significantly decreased by chronic treatment with LY341495. These findings suggest that repeated blockade of the mGlu2 receptor by LY341495 results in reduced 5-HT2A receptor-dependent hallucinogenic effects of LSD. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - "Magic mushrooms" is the most common name given to hallucinogenic fungi containing the psychoactive alkaloids psilocybin and psilocin. In recent years, fungis' sclerotia, commonly called "magic truffles" have become a form of supply of psychoactive Psilocybe alkaloids since Psilocybe sclerotia are not specifically included in the laws banning the sale, the purchase and the use of such substances and mushrooms containing them. A liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the rapid determination of psilocybin and psilocin in Psilocybe sclerotia. Following a simple step extraction with methanol, the alkaloids were separated on a reversed-phase column using a gradient of 0.1% formic acid - acetonitrile s a mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2mL/min.. Separated analytes were detected by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in the positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring. The developed method was linear over the calibration range for all two substances under investigation, with a r2>0.99. The detection and quantification limits were 0.3mug and 1mug per 100mg truffles, for both psilocin and psilocybin and the intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation were always better than 15%. Using this method, the presence of only psilocybin was demonstrated in examined Psilocybe sclerotia. The content of psilocybin was found to vary over a concentration range of 59.3 to 167.8mug per 100mg of fresh sclerotia. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Among different classes of psychotropic drugs, hallucinogenic agents exert one of the most prominent effects on human and animal behaviors, markedly altering sensory, motor, affective, and cognitive responses. The growing clinical and preclinical interest in psychedelic, dissociative, and deliriant hallucinogens necessitates novel translational, sensitive, and high-throughput in vivo models and screens. Primate and rodent models have been traditionally used to study cellular mechanisms and neural circuits of hallucinogenic drugs' action. The utility of zebrafish (Danio rerio) in neuroscience research is rapidly growing due to their high physiological and genetic homology to humans, ease of genetic manipulation, robust behaviors, and cost effectiveness. Possessing a fully characterized genome, both adult and larval zebrafish are currently widely used for in vivo screening of various psychotropic compounds, including hallucinogens and related drugs. Recognizing the growing importance of hallucinogens in biological psychiatry, here we discuss hallucinogenic-induced phenotypes in zebrafish and evaluate their potential as efficient preclinical models of drug-induced states in humans. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

T1  - A proposal to evaluate mechanistic efficacy of hallucinogens in addiction treatment
A1  - Burdick B.V.
A1  - Adinoff B. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Current treatments for addiction are frequently ineffective. Hallucinogenic therapy has been indicated as helpful for a range of substance use disorders, yet this approach remains understudied and publicly unavailable. It is nonetheless a promising treatment, which has significant, long-term beneficial effects with single doses and a profile characterized by general safety, low toxicity, and non-addictiveness. However, pharmacological interventions, such as hallucinogens, should not be offered if the same effects (e.g. psychological insights/mystical experiences) and outcomes (e.g. decreased drug use) could be achieved absent pharmacological intervention. To date, there have been no clinical comparisons of drug-induced altered states with non-drug-induced states for addiction treatment. We propose and then outline a clinical trial to address this gap in knowledge. The proposed design would evaluate abstinence outcomes in a population of prescription opioid abusers after exposure to one of three conditions: a drug-induced altered state using psilocybin, a non-drug-induced altered state via hyperventilation (Holotropic Breathwork), and an active placebo with niacin. The outcomes of such a study would reveal important differences in therapeutic potential by discriminating hallucinogen-dependent effects from those psychological effects resulting from altered states. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

T1  - Methoxetamine (MXE) - A Phenomenological Study of Experiences Induced by a "Legal High" from the Internet
A1  - Kjellgren A.
A1  - Jonsson K. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Methoxetamine (MXE), a ketamine analogue, is one of the new "legal highs" sold on the Internet. The aim of this qualitative study was to provide an initial understanding of what characterizes the experiences induced by MXE. Anonymously written reports (33 persons) on the effects of MXE were collected from public Internet forums and analyzed using the Empirical Phenomenological Psychological Method. The analysis generated 10 themes: (1) preparation, motivation and anticipation; (2) initial effects; (3) malfunction of cognitive processes stabilizing normal state; (4) inner personal processes and learning; (5) emotional processes; (6) altered sensory perception; (7) dissolution and transition; (8) spiritual and transcendental experiences; (9) effects and processes after the experience; (10) re-dosing and addiction. MXE induced a heavily altered state of consciousness. The effects were similar to those induced by classic hallucinogens (such as LSD, psilocybin) and the dissociative ketamine. MXE seemed to have quite a high abuse potential. Beside the positive effects described, negative effects like fear and anxiety were also reported. Acceptance was considered the best coping strategy. Dissolution of identity and body often culminated in spiritual and transcendental experiences. More research is needed on safety issues, how to minimize harm, and the motivation for using legal highs. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - There has been renewed interest in the demarcation of pediatric catatonia from other pediatric conditions including autism. An update on symptoms, prevalence, evaluation, treatment, risk factors, and experimental models of pediatric catatonia is presented. Recent prevalence rates of pediatric catatonia vary widely across studies, suggesting that catatonia may not be rare in younger patients. Symptoms and diagnostic criteria for pediatric catatonia are the same as in adults. Studies and clinical experience support benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy, including maintenance electroconvulsive therapy, as treatment options. Sometimes catatonia develops after severe psychological trauma. Historical and contemporary clinical and experimental catatonia models are available for future research, focusing on motor circuitry dysfunction, abnormal neurotransmitters, epileptic discharges, genetics, neuroendocrine and immune abnormalities, fear reactions akin to the animal defense strategy of tonic immobility, and developmental risk factors. There have been advances in demarcating pediatric catatonia in a wide variety of patients as a treatable condition that requires prompt identificiation. A model of developmental impairment complements clinical and experimental catatonia models. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and impairing condition. A very small percentage of patients become asymptomatic after treatment. The purpose of this paper was to review the alternative therapies available for OCD when conventional treatment fails. Data were extracted from controlled clinical studies (evidence-based medicine) published on the MEDLINE and Science Citation Index/Web of Science databases between 1975 and 2012. Findings are discussed and suggest that clinicians dealing with refractory OCD patients should: 1) review intrinsic phenomenological aspects of OCD, which could lead to different interpretations and treatment choices; 2) review extrinsic phenomenological aspects of OCD, especially family accommodation, which may be a risk factor for non-response; 3) consider non-conventional pharmacological approaches; 4) consider non- -conventional psychotherapeutic approaches; and 5) consider neurobiological approaches.

N2  - Many psychoactive drugs are used recreationally, particularly by young people. This use and its perceived dangers have led to many different classes of drugs being banned under national laws and international conventions. Indeed, the possession of cannabis, 3,4.methylenedioxy-.N.methylamphetamine (MDMA; also known as ecstasy) and psychedelics is stringently regulated. An important and unfortunate outcome of the controls placed on these and other psychoactive drugs is that they make research into their mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic uses - for example, in depression and post-.traumatic stress disorder - difficult and in many cases almost impossible. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

N2  - Drugs that modulate serotonin (5-HT) synaptic concentrations impact neurogenesis and hippocampal (HPC)-dependent learning. The primary objective is to determine the extent to which psilocybin (PSOP) modulates neurogenesis and thereby affects acquisition and extinction of HPC-dependent trace fear conditioning. PSOP, the 5-HT2Aagonist 25I-NBMeO and the 5-HT 2A/Cantagonist ketanserin were administered via an acute intraperitoneal injection to mice. Trace fear conditioning was measured as the amount of time spent immobile in the presence of the conditioned stimulus (CS, auditory tone), trace (silent interval) and post-trace interval over 10 trials. Extinction was determined by the number of trials required to resume mobility during CS, trace and post-trace when the shock was not delivered. Neurogenesis was determined by unbiased counts of cells in the dentate gyrus of the HPC birthdated with BrdU co-expressing a neuronal marker. Mice treated with a range of doses of PSOP acquired a robust conditioned fear response. Mice injected with low doses of PSOP extinguished cued fear conditioning significantly more rapidly than high-dose PSOP or saline-treated mice. Injection of PSOP, 25I-NBMeO or ketanserin resulted in significant dose-dependent decreases in number of newborn neurons in hippocampus. At the low doses of PSOP that enhanced extinction, neurogenesis was not decreased, but rather tended toward an increase. Extinction of "fear conditioning" may be mediated by actions of the drugs at sites other than hippocampus such as the amygdala, which is known to mediate the perception of fear. Another caveat is that PSOP is not purely selective for 5-HT2A receptors. PSOP facilitates extinction of the classically conditioned fear response, and this, and similar agents, should be explored as potential treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder and related conditions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

N2  - Despite the widespread application of drug modelling in psychiatric research, the relative value of different models has never been formally compared in the same analysis. Here we compared the effects of five drugs (cannabis, psilocybin, amphetamine, ketamine and alcohol) in relation to psychiatric symptoms in a two-part subjective analysis. In the first part, mental health professionals associated statements referring to specific experiences, for example 'I don't bother to get out of bed', to one or more psychiatric symptom clusters, for example depression and negative psychotic symptoms. This measured the specificity of an experience for a particular disorder. In the second part, individuals with personal experience with each of the above-listed drugs were asked how reliably each drug produced the experiences listed in part 1, both acutely and sub-acutely. Part 1 failed to find any experiences that were specific for negative or cognitive psychotic symptoms over depression. The best model of positive symptoms was psilocybin and the best models overall were the acute alcohol and amphetamine models of mania. These results challenge current assumptions about drug models and motivate further research on this understudied area. © The Author(s) 2013.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background and Objectives: Over the past decade, non-medical use of novel drugs has proliferated worldwide. In most cases these are synthetic drugs first synthesized in academic or pharmaceutical laboratories for research or drug development purposes, but also include naturally occurring substances that do not fit the typical pharmacological or behavioral profile of traditional illicit substances. Perhaps most unique to this generation of new drugs is that they are being sold over the counter and on the Internet as "legal highs" or substitutes for traditional illicit drugs such as cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, MDMA, and LSD. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of novel drugs in current use, including the epidemiology of use and toxicologic and pharmacological properties, and to offer some guidelines to clinicians who see patients experiencing adverse effects from these drugs. Method: We review the known scientific literature on recently introduced synthetic drug types, synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cathinones, and the hallucinogen Salvia divinorum. Results: These substances comprise part of a rapidly evolving and controversial drug market that has challenged definitions of what is legal and illegal, has benefitted from open commercial sales without regulatory oversight, and is noteworthy for the pace at which new substances are introduced. Conclusions: This emerging trend in substance use presents significant and unique public health and criminal justice challenges. At this time, these substances are not detected in routine drug screens and substance-specific treatment for cases of use-related toxicity are not available. Clinicians are encouraged to learn characteristic signs associated with misuse of novel drugs to recognize cases in their practice, and are recommended to use a symptom-specific approach for treatment in each case. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - In the past decade, neuroimaging research has begun to identify key brain regions involved in self-referential processing, most consistently midline structures such as the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The majority of studies have employed cognitive tasks such as judgment about trait adjectives or mind wandering, that have been associated with increased PCC activity. Conversely, tasks that share an element of present-centered attention (being "on task"), ranging from working memory to meditation, have been associated with decreased PCC activity. Given the complexity of cognitive processes that likely contribute to these tasks, the specific contribution of the PCC to self-related processes still remains unknown. Building on this prior literature, recent studies have employed sampling methods that more precisely link subjective experience to brain activity, such as real-time fMRI neurofeedback. This recent work suggests that PCC activity may represent a sub-component cognitive process of self-reference - "getting caught up in" one's experience. For example, getting caught up in a drug craving or a particular viewpoint. In this paper, we will review evidence across a number of different domains of cognitive neuroscience that converges in activation and deactivation of the PCC including recent neurophenomenological studies of PCC activity using real-time fMRI neurofeedback. © 2013 Brewer, Garrison and Whitfield-Gabrieli.

A1  - McGeeney B.E. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Hallucinogens and most cannabinoids are classified under schedule 1 of the Federal Controlled Substances Act 1970, along with heroin and ecstacy. Hence they cannot be prescribed by physicians, and by implication, have no accepted medical use with a high abuse potential. Despite their legal status, hallucinogens and cannabinoids are used by patients for relief of headache, helped by the growing number of American states that have legalized medical marijuana. Cannabinoids in particular have a long history of use in the abortive and prophylactic treatment of migraine before prohibition and are still used by patients as a migraine abortive in particular. Most practitioners are unaware of the prominence cannabis or "marijuana" once held in medical practice. Hallucinogens are being increasingly used by cluster headache patients outside of physician recommendation mainly to abort a cluster period and maintain quiescence for which there is considerable anecdotal success. The legal status of cannabinoids and hallucinogens has for a long time severely inhibited medical research, and there are still no blinded studies on headache subjects, from which we could assess true efficacy. © 2012 American Headache Society.

T1  - Safety and Side Effects of Ayahuasca in Humans-An Overview Focusing on Developmental Toxicology
A1  - Guimaraes dos Santos R. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Despite being relatively well studied from a botanical, chemical, and (acute) pharmacological perspective, little is known about the possible toxic effects of ayahuasca (an hallucinogenic brew used for magico-ritual purposes) in pregnant women and in their children, and the potential toxicity of long-term ayahuasca consumption. It is the main objective of the present text to do an overview of the risks and possible toxic effects of ayahuasca in humans, reviewing studies on the acute ayahuasca administration to humans, on the possible risks associated with long-term consumption by adults and adolescents, and on the possible toxic effects on pregnant animals and in their offspring. Acute ayahuasca administration, as well as long-term consumption of this beverage, does not seem to be seriously toxic to humans. Although some nonhuman developmental studies suggested possible toxic effects of ayahuasca or of some of its alkaloids, the limited human literature on adolescents exposed to ayahuasca as early as in the uterus reports no serious toxic effects of the ritual consumption of the brew. Researchers must take caution when extrapolating nonhuman data to humans and more data are needed in basic and human research before a definite opinion can be made regarding the possible toxic effects of ayahuasca in pregnant women and in their children. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

T1  - Experienced Drug Users Assess the Relative Harms and Benefits of Drugs: A Web-Based Survey
A1  - Carhart-Harris R.L.
A1  - Nutt D.J. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - A web-based survey was used to consult the opinions of experienced drug users on matters related to drug harms. We identified a rare sample of 93 drug users with personal experience with 11 different illicit drugs that are widely used in the UK. Asked to assess the relative harms of these drugs, they ranked alcohol and tobacco as the most harmful, and three "Class A" drugs (MDMA, LSD, and psilocybin) and one class B (cannabis) were ranked as the four least harmful drugs. When asked to assess the relative potential for benefit of the 11 drugs, MDMA, LSD, psilocybin, and cannabis were ranked in the top four; and when asked why these drugs are beneficial, rather than simply report hedonic properties, they referred to potential therapeutic applications (e.g., as tools to assist psychotherapy). These results provide a useful insight into the opinions of experienced drug users on a subject about which they have a rare and intimate knowledge. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Objective: To know the pattern of use of new psychoactive substances (NPSs) in a Spanish sample of research chemical (RC) users and to deepen the RC user profile and risk reduction strategies employed. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional survey by means of a specific questionnaire. Recruitment was carried out at music festivals, at non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and through announcements on an online forum. Two RC user profiles were defined, according to whether they search information through online forums. Results: A total of participated. The most frequent RCs were hallucinogenic phenethylamines (2C-B 80.0%, 2C-I 39.6%) and cathinones (methylone 40.1%, mephedrone 35.2%). The most frequent combination of RC with other illegal drugs was with cannabis (68.6%) and 2C-B with MDMA (28.3%). Subjects who are consulting drug forums (group 1) use more RC, obtain RC by Internet, and use more frequently risk prevention strategies. Regarding the risk-reduction strategies in this group, users sought information concerning RC before consuming them (100%), used precision scales to calculate dosage (72.3%), and analyzed the contents before consumption (68.8%). Conclusions:There is a specific RC user profile with extensive knowledge and consumption of substances, using different strategies to reduce risks associated to its consumption. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - Salvia divinorum: From Mazatec medicinal and hallucinogenic plant to emerging recreational drug
A1  - Zawilska J.B.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Salvia divinorum is a sage endemic to a small region of Mexico and has been traditionally used by the Mazatec Indians for divination and spiritual healing. Recently, it has gained increased popularity as a recreational drug, used by adolescents and young adults as an alternative to marijuana and LSD. Salvinorin A, the major active ingredient of the plant, is considered to be the most potent known hallucinogen of natural origin. This review surveys the current state of knowledge on the neurochemical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacological properties of salvinorin A, the trends and motivation behind S. divinorum use, and the health problems among users of the plant's products. S. divinorum induces intense, but short-lived, psychedelic-like changes in mood and perception, with concomitant hallucinations and disorientation. Many websites have misinterpreted the limited existing research-based information on the side effects of salvia as evidence for its safety. However, data accumulated over the last few years indicate that potential health risks are associated with the use of S. divinorum, especially by teenagers, users of other substances of abuse, and individuals with underlying psychotic disturbances. Taken together, the data presented in this review point to the need for further basic and clinical studies to create a basis for the development of well-addressed prevention and treatment strategies.

T1  - Serotonergic hallucinogens as translational models relevant to schizophrenia
A1  - Halberstadt A.L.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Abstract One of the oldest models of schizophrenia is based on the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens such as mescaline, psilocybin, and (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), which act through the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. These compounds produce a 'model psychosis' in normal individuals that resembles at least some of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Based on these similarities, and because evidence has emerged that the serotonergic system plays a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia in some patients, animal models relevant to schizophrenia have been developed based on hallucinogen effects. Here we review the behavioural effects of hallucinogens in four of those models, the receptor and neurochemical mechanisms for the effects and their translational relevance. Despite the difficulty of modelling hallucinogen effects in nonverbal species, animal models of schizophrenia based on hallucinogens have yielded important insights into the linkage between 5-HT and schizophrenia and have helped to identify receptor targets and interactions that could be exploited in the development of new therapeutic agents. © CINP 2013.

N2  - Abstract One of the main obstacles faced by translational neuroscience is the development of animal models of psychiatric disorders. Behavioural pharmacology studies indicate that psychedelic drugs, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and dissociative drugs, such as phencyclidine (PCP), induce in healthy human volunteers psychotic and cognitive symptoms that resemble some of those observed in schizophrenia patients. Serotonin 5-HT2A and metabotropic glutamate 2 receptors have been involved in the mechanism of action of psychedelic and dissociative drugs. Here we review recent advances using LSD-like and PCP-like drugs in rodent models that implicate these receptors in the neurobiology of schizophrenia and its treatment. © CINP 2013.

N2  - Psychedelic drugs produce profound changes in consciousness, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms for this remain unclear. Spontaneous and induced oscillatory activity was recorded in healthy human participants with magnetoencephalography after intravenous infusion of psilocybin-prodrug of the nonselective serotonin 2A receptor agonist and classic psychedelic psilocin. Psilocybin reduced spontaneous cortical oscillatory power from 1 to 50 Hz in posterior association cortices, and from 8 to 100 Hz in frontal association cortices. Large decreases in oscillatory power were seen in areas of the default-mode network. Independent component analysis was used to identify a number of resting-state networks, and activity in these was similarly decreased after psilocybin. Psilocybin had no effect on low-level visually induced and motor-induced gamma-band oscillations, suggesting that some basic elements of oscillatory brain activity are relatively preserved during the psychedelic experience. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that posterior cingulate cortex desynchronization can be explained by increased excitability of deep-layer pyramidal neurons, which are known to be rich in 5-HT2A receptors. These findings suggest that the subjective effects of psychedelics result from a desynchronization of ongoing oscillatory rhythms in the cortex, likely triggered by 5-HT2A receptor-mediated excitation of deep pyramidal cells. © 2013 the authors.

T1  - Single treatments that have lasting effects: Some thoughts on the antidepressant effects of ketamine and botulinum toxin and the anxiolytic effect of psilocybin
A1  - Young S.N. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Recent clinical trials suggest that 3 single biological treatments have effects that persist. Based on research showing that the muscles involved in facial expressions can feed back to influence mood, a single trial diminishing glabella frown lines with botulinum toxin demonstrated a significant antidepressant effect for 16 weeks. Based primarily on research with animal models of depression suggesting that glutamate may be involved in depression, the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine has been tested in several trials. A single dose decreased depression for up to a week. The reported effects of the use of mushrooms containing psilocybin by a number of cultures around the world has stimulated several trials showing beneficial effects of a single dose of psilocybin for over a year in healthy people, and for up to 3 months in patients with anxiety disorders who have advanced cancer. This article discusses these studies, their rationale, their possible mechanisms of action, the future clinical research required to establish these therapies and the basic research required to optimize single treatments that have lasting effects. © 2013 Canadian Medical Association.

N2  - Psilocybin/psilocin from so-called psychoactive mushrooms causes hallucinogenic effects. Especially for people with mental or psychiatric disorders ingestion of magic mushrooms may result in horror trips combined with the intention of self-destruction and suicidal thoughts. Automutilation after consumption of hallucinogenic mushrooms has already been described. Our case report demonstrates the suicide of a man by self-inflicted cut and stab injuries. A causal connection between suicidal behaviour and previous ingestion of psychoactive mushrooms is discussed.

A1  - Olthuis J.V.

A1  - Barrett S.P. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Introduction and Aims. Simultaneous polysubstance use (SPU) is a common phenomenon, yet little is known about its role in substance use initiation. Design and Methods. In the present study, 226 cannabis users completed structured interviews about their substance use history. For each substance ever used, participants provided details of their age of first use, their use in the preceding 30days and whether they co-administered any other licit or illicit substances the first time they used the substance. Results. For most illicit substances [powder cocaine, crack, amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy), heroin, opium, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), ketamine, psilocybin (magic mushrooms), mescaline, phencyclidine (PCP), peyote and inhalants], results showed that a clear majority of participants (>=75%) reported SPU during their first-ever use of the substance. While SPU was less common on occasions of first use of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis, a high proportion of SPU on occasions of first use of 'harder' drugs could be accounted for by the co-use of alcohol, tobacco and/or cannabis. Discussion and Conclusions. Such findings raise the possibility that specific alcohol, tobacco and/or cannabis use episodes might directly contribute to the initiation of new substance use. Understanding the role of SPU on occasions of first use might help better identify risk factors for substance use progression and improve intervention efforts.[Olthuis JV, Darredeau C, Barrett SP.

N2  - A validated method for the simultaneous determination of psilocin, bufotenine, lysergic acid diethylamide and its metabolites in serum, plasma and urine using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry was developed. During the solid-phase extraction procedure with polymeric mixed-mode cation exchange columns, the unstable analytes were protected by ascorbic acid, drying with nitrogen and exclusion of light. The limits of detection and quantitation for all analytes were low. Recovery was >=86 % for all analytes and no significant matrix effects were observed. Interday and intraday imprecisions at different concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 8.2 % relative standard deviation, bias was within +/-5.3 %. Processed samples were stable in the autosampler for at least 2 days. Furthermore, freeze/thaw and long-term stability were investigated. The method was successfully applied to authentic serum and urine samples.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The classical serotonergic psychedelics LSD, psilocybin, mescaline are not known to cause brain damage and are regarded as non-addictive. Clinical studies do not suggest that psychedelics cause long-term mental health problems. Psychedelics have been used in the Americas for thousands of years. Over 30 million people currently living in the US have used LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the lifetime use of psychedelics and current mental health in the adult population., METHOD: Data drawn from years 2001 to 2004 of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health consisted of 130,152 respondents, randomly selected to be representative of the adult population in the United States. Standardized screening measures for past year mental health included serious psychological distress (K6 scale), mental health treatment (inpatient, outpatient, medication, needed but did not receive), symptoms of eight psychiatric disorders (panic disorder, major depressive episode, mania, social phobia, general anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-affective psychosis), and seven specific symptoms of non-affective psychosis. We calculated weighted odds ratios by multivariate logistic regression controlling for a range of sociodemographic variables, use of illicit drugs, risk taking behavior, and exposure to traumatic events., RESULTS: 21,967 respondents (13.4% weighted) reported lifetime psychedelic use. There were no significant associations between lifetime use of any psychedelics, lifetime use of specific psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, peyote), or past year use of LSD and increased rate of any of the mental health outcomes. Rather, in several cases psychedelic use was associated with lower rate of mental health problems., CONCLUSION: We did not find use of psychedelics to be an independent risk factor for mental health problems.

N2  - A validated method for the simultaneous determination of psilocin, bufotenine, lysergic acid diethylamide and its metabolites in serum, plasma and urine using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry was developed. During the solid-phase extraction procedure with polymeric mixed-mode cation exchange columns, the unstable analytes were protected by ascorbic acid, drying with nitrogen and exclusion of light. The limits of detection and quantitation for all analytes were low. Recovery was >=86 % for all analytes and no significant matrix effects were observed. Interday and intraday imprecisions at different concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 8.2 % relative standard deviation, bias was within +/-5.3 %. Processed samples were stable in the autosampler for at least 2 days. Furthermore, freeze/thaw and long-term stability were investigated. The method was successfully applied to authentic serum and urine samples.

N2  - Background: Hallucinogenic fungi have been used in divinatory or religious contexts. Today the use to enhance emotions, to disconnect from reality. There are 2 groups. 1. Mushrooms containing ibotenic acid muscimol like A. muscaria, A. pantherina. 2. Mushrooms containing psilocybin. Case presentation: A 28 year old man was admitted to our ER. due to confusion, irritability.Occured after ingestion of mushrooms collected by himself. On admission, he had lacerated scalp wound in the occipital region after head trauma. The biochemical and hematological parameters were normal. A Brain CT scan was negative to injury. His girlfriend arrived in ER. with mushrooms, they were like mushrooms in (Figures 2) and with the help of the mycologist the diagnosis was confirmed Amanita Pantherina Toxicity. Discussion: The pantherina contain ibotenic acid muscimol. Ibotenic acid resembles glutamic acid and is an agonist at central glutamic acid receptors; its decarboxylated derivative, muscimol,is an agonist (GABA) receptors. The ingestion of these mushroom group produce ethanol-like intoxication and jerking movements, hallucinations may be accompanied by dysarthria, ataxia, muscle cramps and may persist for 8 hours. Symptoms typically occur within 90 minutes of ingestion. In ER. benzodiazepines used for sedation, to treat hallucinations, and seizures. Gastric lavage and activated charcoal used within 1 hour of ingestion.

N2  - Ixabepilone (Ix), a microtubule targeting chemotherapy agent, is associated with peripheral nerve toxicity. To study the effect of Ixabepilone on small sensory fibers in skin, 15 subjects were followed longitudinally on weekly or q 3 week Ix cycles (Cy). 12 subjects were followed for 3 or more Cy and had a baseline total neuropathy score clinical (TNSc) of 3.7 that increased to 6.0 after 3 Cy (120-160 mg/m2) and 7.7 after 7 cycles (336 mg/m2). Distal skin biopsies from 6 patients starting on 3rd and 7th Ix Cy and controls were processed for ultrastructural analysis. Thin 60-70 nm sections from each block were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and scanned under electron microscope. Remak Schwann cell bundles were identified and quantified in the dermis of biopsies using previously specified criteria. In controls, Remak bundles had predominantly 1-2 axons (47%) and 20% had 5-6 axons. Few degenerating (4%) Schwann cells were identified. In Ix-treated biopsies, empty Schwann cells without axons increased from 25% in 3rd cycle to 42% in 7th cycle. Axonal loss was progressive in larger Remaks and shifted to the left (1-2 axons: - 3rd Cy: 54%; 7th Cy: 39%; 5-6 axons: - 3rd Cy: 10.2%; 7th Cy: 1.6%). Axons were in varying sizes, showed dilatation and contained abnormally dilated microtubules and dissolution of axonal contents. Schwann cells displayed cytoplasmic edema, fat vacuoles, microvesicles, axonal debris, poly-axonal pockets, and dense clusters of abnormal mitochondria with distorted cristae. Schwann cell cytoplasmic ingrowths partitioned axoplasm into compartments spiraled around producing an onion bulb appearance. Empty Schwann cell tubes and many shredded basal lamina were observed. Deeper dermis showed degenerating myelinated fibers without cytoskeletal organelles and myelin debris within macrophages. The dermis during the 7th Cy exhibited dense infiltration with macrophages and increased fibroblastic activity. Our study confirms that Ixabepilone affects distal unmyelinated and myelinated fibers with severe Schwann cell degeneration. The dose dependent toxicity observed in the form of progressive axonal degeneration and fibroblastic activity seen in these serial skin biopsies suggests a cumulative effect that can be monitored through skin biopsy-based analysis.

N2  - The last 50 years of researches of biochemism and the CNS functionality are intensively engaged in studying the role of monoamine neurotramsmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamin) (5-HT). The serotonergic receptors function depends on spot where the receptor function, the dynamic relationship with other transmitters and stimulation that can activate or inhibit specific neurons. The results of research in biochemistry, neurophysiology and neuroradiology have provided insight into the complexity of the operation of key structures such as the amygdala, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, whose role varies depending on the received external impulses and the impulses that are sent to relevant areas. This implies that the transmitters and especially 5-HT, have much wider effects that are determined not to structures but by the impulse dynamics. It also means that psychopharmaceutical drugs whose therapeutic effect is based on the change of the concentration of serotonin in the synapse and the postsynaptic receptors depending on where they operate, have an effect on affective or cognitive symptoms. Serotonergic antidepressants by changing the concentration of serotonin change primarily affective manifestations but also they have significant influence on all the spectrum of serotonergic disorders not only emotional, but also the cognitive level, which is also a confirmation that the therapeutic effects do not depend only on the simple change of serotonin concentration but also of the level where these changes occur in dynamic comparison of key transmitters. Atypical antipsychotics which have low affinity for dopaminergic and high affinity for serotonergic receptors are seen through the dynamic relationship of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenalin in nigrostriatal, mezocortical, mezolimbic and tuberoinfudibular pathways. © Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia.

T1  - 'Legal Highs' novel and emerging psychoactive drugs: A chemical overview for the toxicologist
A1  - Gibbons S. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Introduction. 'Legal highs' are psychoactive chemicals which are sold from 'head shops', the internet and from street suppliers and may be possessed without legal restriction. An increase in the marketing of these materials has resulted in a corresponding increase in published reports of their adverse effects. However, a lack of primary literature pertaining to their chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology, makes an evaluation of their harm difficult. This review covers the basic chemistry of these novel psychoactive compounds and relates them to endogenous neurotransmitters and existing drugs of abuse. Methods. A survey of the internet was used to identify websites that are marketing 'legal highs' in the UK. Trivial and systematic chemical compound names, for example methoxetamine, 4-methoxyphencycline, 4-fluorotropacocaine and ethyl phenidate were entered into PubMed to retrieve data on these compounds. This search elicited no citations. Other search terms which were more fruitful included desoxypipradrol, diphenylprolinol, methylenedioxy-2-amino-indane and methylenedioxy-2-amino-tetralin, alpha-methyltryptamine and 5-methoxy-N,N- diallyl-tryptamine. Results. 'Legal highs' from the phenylethylamine, cocaine, tryptamine and phencyclidine classes are increasingly being marketed and, in the majority of cases, little is cited in the literature on their true chemical identity, pharmacology or toxicology. Conclusions. 'Legal highs' are gaining in popularity and present clear challenges to toxicologists and society as a whole. Whilst improved use of existing legislation and development of new legislation can be used to reduce the supply of these materials, investment in better education for young people on the harms associated with 'legal highs' is needed. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Objective To describe patterns of simultaneous polysubstance use (SPU) among Danish 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) ("Ecstasy") and hallucinogen users. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 98 active MDMA and/or hallucinogen users recruited through homepage advertisements, flyers, and word of mouth in Denmark. Lifetime and recent substance use and SPU at last recalled use was described by structured interviews. Hair samples from a subset of participants were analyzed for MDMA. Results The participants had used an average of 12.6 (95% confidence interval: 11.7-13.4) psychoactive substances during their lifetime. SPU was prevalent among MDMA, d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and psilocybin users, in particular with alcohol and cannabis. Among MDMA users, 69% had combined MDMA with amphetamines, 56% with hallucinogens, and 47% with cocaine. At last recalled use, MDMA was taken with 2.1 +/- 1.2 substances in 32 different combinations. The participants preferred specific drug combinations and named several, which in their experience enhanced or counteracted each other. Alcohol and cannabis were typically used before, during, and after MDMA, LSD, and psilocybin, whereas amphetamines were predominantly taken before these substances. When LSD was combined with MDMA, the majority took MDMA after LSD. Conclusions Simultaneous polysubstance use was common among Danish MDMA and hallucinogen users, and patterns of preferred substance combinations were evident. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Amphetamines represent a class of psychotropic compounds, widely abused for their stimulant, euphoric, anorectic, and, in some cases, emphathogenic, entactogenic, and hallucinogenic properties. These compounds derive from the beta-phenylethylamine core structure and are kinetically and dynamically characterized by easily crossing the blood-brain barrier, to resist brain biotransformation and to release monoamine neurotransmitters from nerve endings. Although amphetamines are widely acknowledged as synthetic drugs, of which amphetamine, methamphetamine, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) are well-known examples, humans have used natural amphetamines for several millenniums, through the consumption of amphetamines produced in plants, namely cathinone (khat), obtained from the plant Catha edulis and ephedrine, obtained from various plants in the genus Ephedra. More recently, a wave of new amphetamines has emerged in the market, mainly constituted of cathinone derivatives, including mephedrone, methylone, methedrone, and buthylone, among others. Although intoxications by amphetamines continue to be common causes of emergency department and hospital admissions, it is frequent to find the sophism that amphetamine derivatives, namely those appearing more recently, are relatively safe. However, human intoxications by these drugs are increasingly being reported, with similar patterns compared to those previously seen with classical amphetamines. That is not surprising, considering the similar structures and mechanisms of action among the different amphetamines, conferring similar toxicokinetic and toxicological profiles to these compounds. The aim of the present review is to give an insight into the pharmacokinetics, general mechanisms of biological and toxicological actions, and the main target organs for the toxicity of amphetamines. Although there is still scarce knowledge from novel amphetamines to draw mechanistic insights, the long-studied classical amphetamines-amphetamine itself, as well as methamphetamine and MDMA, provide plenty of data that may be useful to predict toxicological outcome to improvident abusers and are for that reason the main focus of this review. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

N2  - Background: Serotonin (5-HT) 1A and 2A receptors have been associated with dysfunctional emotional processing biases in mood disorders. These receptors further predominantly mediate the subjective and behavioral effects of psilocybin and might be important for its recently suggested antidepressive effects. However, the effect of psilocybin on emotional processing biases and the specific contribution of 5-HT2A receptors across different emotional domains is unknown. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind study, 17 healthy human subjects received on 4 separate days placebo, psilocybin (215 mug/kg), the preferential 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (50 mg), or psilocybin plus ketanserin. Mood states were assessed by self-report ratings, and behavioral and event-related potential measurements were used to quantify facial emotional recognition and goal-directed behavior toward emotional cues. Results: Psilocybin enhanced positive mood and attenuated recognition of negative facial expression. Furthermore, psilocybin increased goal-directed behavior toward positive compared with negative cues, facilitated positive but inhibited negative sequential emotional effects, and valence-dependently attenuated the P300 component. Ketanserin alone had no effects but blocked the psilocybin-induced mood enhancement and decreased recognition of negative facial expression. Conclusions: This study shows that psilocybin shifts the emotional bias across various psychological domains and that activation of 5-HT2A receptors is central in mood regulation and emotional face recognition in healthy subjects. These findings may not only have implications for the pathophysiology of dysfunctional emotional biases but may also provide a framework to delineate the mechanisms underlying psylocybin's putative antidepressant effects. © 2012 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

N2  - Basic research in animals represents a fruitful approach to study the neurobiological basis of brain and behavioral disturbances relevant to neuropsychiatric disease and to establish and evaluate novel pharmacological therapies for their treatment. In the context of schizophrenia, there are models employing specific experimental manipulations developed according to specific pathophysiological or etiological hypotheses. The use of selective lesions in adult animals and the acute administration of psychotomimetic agents are indispensable tools in the elucidation of the contribution of specific brain regions or neurotransmitters to the genesis of a specific symptom or collection of symptoms and enjoy some degrees of predictive validity. However, they may be inaccurate, if not inadequate, in capturing the etiological mechanisms or ontology of the disease needed for a complete understanding of the disease and may be limited in the discovery of novel compounds for the treatment of negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Under the prevailing consensus of schizophrenia as a disease of neurodevelopmental origin, we have seen the establishment of neurodevelopmental animal models which aim to identify the etiological processes whereby the brain, following specific triggering events, develops into a schizophrenia-like brain over time. Many neurodevelopmental models such as the neonatal ventral hippocampus (vHPC) lesion, methylazoxymethanol (MAM), and prenatal immune activation models can mimic a broad spectrum of behavioral, cognitive, and pharmacological abnormalities directly implicated in schizophrenic disease. These models allow pharmacological screens against multiple and coexisting schizophrenia-related dysfunctions while incorporating the disease-relevant concept of abnormal brain development. The multiplicity of existing models is testimonial to the multifactorial nature of schizophrenia, and there are ample opportunities for their integration. Indeed, one ultimate goal must be to incorporate the successes of distinct models into one unitary account of the complex disorder of schizophrenia and to use such unitary approaches in the further development and evaluation of novel antipsychotic treatment strategies. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

T1  - Repression of death consciousness and the psychedelic trip
A1  - Dutta V. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Death is our most repressed consciousness, it inheres our condition as the primordial fear. Perhaps it was necessary that this angst be repressed in man or he would be hurled against the dark forces of nature. Modern ethos was built on this edifice, where the 'denial of death' while 'embracing one's symbolic immortality' would be worshipped, so this ideology simply overturned and repressed looking into the morass of the inevitable when it finally announced itself. Once this slowly pieced its way into all of life, 'death' would soon become a terminology in medicine too and assert its position, by giving a push to those directly dealing with the dying to shy away from its emotional and spiritual affliction. The need to put off death and prolong one's life would become ever more urgent. Research using psychedelics on the terminally ill which had begun in the 1950s and 1960s would coerce into another realm and alter the face of medicine; but the aggression with which it forced itself in the 1960s would soon be politically maimed, and what remained would be sporadic outpours that trickled its way from European labs and underground boot camps. Now, with the curtain rising, the question has etched itself again, about the use of psychedelic drugs in medicine, particularly psychedelic psychotherapy with the terminally ill. This study is an attempt to philosophically explore death anxiety from its existential context and how something that is innate in our condition cannot be therapeutically cured. Psychedelic use was immutably linked with ancient cultures and only recently has it seen its scientific revival, from which a scientific culture grew around psychedelic therapy. How much of what was threaded in the ritual and spiritual mores can be extricated and be interpreted in our own mechanized language of medicine is the question that nudges many.

N2  - The cyclic peptide toxins of poisonous Amanita mushrooms are chemically unique among known natural products. Furthermore, they differ from other fungal cyclic peptides in being synthesized on ribosomes instead of by nonribosomal peptide synthetases. Because of their novel structures and biogenic origins, elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of the Amanita cyclic peptides presents both challenges and opportunities. In particular, a full understanding of the pathway should lead to the ability to direct synthesis of a large number of novel cyclic peptides based on the Amanita toxin scaffold by genetic engineering of the encoding genes. Here, we highlight some of the principal methods for working with the Amanita cyclic peptides and the known steps in their biosynthesis. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Despite some principal similarities, there is no systematic comparison between the different types of synesthesia (genuine, acquired and drug-induced). This comprehensive review compares the three principal types of synesthesia and focuses on their phenomenological features and their relation to different etiological models. Implications of this comparison for the validity of the different etiological models are discussed.Comparison of the three forms of synesthesia show many more differences than similarities. This is in contrast to their representation in the literature, where they are discussed in many respects as being virtually similar. Noteworthy is the much broader spectrum and intensity with the typical drug-induced synesthesias compared to genuine and acquired synesthesias. A major implication of the phenomenological comparison in regard to the etiological models is that genuine and acquired synesthesias point to morphological substrates, while drug-induced synesthesia appears to be based on functional changes of brain activity. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Illicit Use of LSD or Psilocybin, but not MDMA or Nonpsychedelic Drugs, is Associated with Mystical Experiences in a Dose-Dependent Manner

N2  - Psychedelic drugs have long been known to be capable of inducing mystical or transcendental experiences. However, given the common "recreational" nature of much present-day psychedelic use, with typical doses tending to be lower than those commonly taken in the 1960s, the extent to which illicit use of psychedelics today is associated with mystical experiences is not known. Furthermore the mild psychedelic MDMA ("Ecstasy") is more popular today than "full" psychedelics such as LSD or psilocybin, and the contribution of illicit MDMA use to mystical experiences is not known. The present study recruited 337 adults from the website and newsletter of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), most of whom reported use of a variety of drugs both licit and illicit including psychedelics. Although only a quarter of the sample reported "spiritual" motives for using psychedelics, use of LSD and psilocybin was significantly positively related to scores on two well-known indices of mystical experiences in a dose-related manner, whereas use of MDMA, cannabis, cocaine, opiates and alcohol was not. Results suggest that even in today's context of "recreational" drug use, psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin, when taken at higher doses, continue to induce mystical experiences in many users. © 2012 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - The incidence of fungal poisoning varies a lot in a global perspective and is related to local habits, economic factors and lifestyle. Among thousands of mushroom species fewer than a hundred are toxic. Most fungal toxins cause mild or moderate poisoning. However, it is the ingestion of a few species of extremely poisonous fungi that define the medical dimension of the problem. Mushroom poisoning is mostly accidental and the result of a mix-up between edible and toxic fungi, but intentional ingestion of psychotropic ('magic') mushrooms is also a problem. The most dreaded poisonings are those caused by cytotoxic agents, e.g. amatoxins in death cap and destroying angel (severe gastroenteritis and liver damage) or orellanine in Cortinarius spp. (kidney damage). Dramatic, but rarely lethal, effects are caused by fungi holding neurotoxins like muscarine (Clitocybe and Inocybe spp.), psilocybin (Psilocybe and Panaeolus spp. - 'magic' mushrooms), isoxazoles (fly agaric and panther cap) and gyromitrin (false morels). Most poisonous species cause gastroenteritis only. Treatment includes gastrointestinal decontamination and general symptomatic and supportive care. Specific antidotes exist for fungi containing muscarine, gyromitrin and amatoxins. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Responses to hallucinogenic drugs, such as psilocybin, are believed to be critically dependent on the user's personality, current mood state, drug pre-experiences, expectancies, and social and environmental variables. However, little is known about the order of importance of these variables and their effect sizes in comparison to drug dose. Hence, this study investigated the effects of 24 predictor variables, including age, sex, education, personality traits, drug pre-experience, mental state before drug intake, experimental setting, and drug dose on the acute response to psilocybin. The analysis was based on the pooled data of 23 controlled experimental studies involving 409 psilocybin administrations to 261 healthy volunteers. Multiple linear mixed effects models were fitted for each of 15 response variables. Although drug dose was clearly the most important predictor for all measured response variables, several non-pharmacological variables significantly contributed to the effects of psilocybin. Specifically, having a high score in the personality trait of Absorption, being in an emotionally excitable and active state immediately before drug intake, and having experienced few psychological problems in past weeks were most strongly associated with pleasant and mystical-type experiences, whereas high Emotional Excitability, low age, and an experimental setting involving positron emission tomography most strongly predicted unpleasant and/or anxious reactions to psilocybin. The results confirm that non-pharmacological variables play an important role in the effects of psilocybin. © 2012 Studerus et al.

N2  - Psychedelic drugs have a long history of use in healing ceremonies, but despite renewed interest in their therapeutic potential, we continue to know very little about howthey work in the brain. Here we used psilocybin, a classic psychedelic found in magic mushrooms, and a task-free functional MRI (fMRI) protocol designed to capture the transition from normalwaking consciousness to the psychedelic state. Arterial spin labeling perfusion and blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI were used to map cerebral blood flow and changes in venous oxygenation before and after intravenous infusions of placebo and psilocybin. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned with arterial spin labeling and a separate 15 with BOLD. As predicted, profound changes in consciousness were observed after psilocybin, but surprisingly, only decreases in cerebral blood flow and BOLD signal were seen, and these were maximal in hub regions, such as the thalamus and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC). Decreased activity in the ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was a consistent finding and the magnitude of this decrease predicted the intensity of the subjective effects. Based on these results, a seed-based pharmaco-physiological interaction/ functional connectivity analysis was performed using a medial prefrontal seed. Psilocybin caused a significant decrease in the positive coupling between the mPFC and PCC. These results strongly imply that the subjective effects of psychedelic drugs are caused by decreased activity and connectivity in the brain's key connector hubs, enabling a state of unconstrained cognition.

N2  - The prognosis of patients with altered consciousness is mainly determined by early diagnosis and appropriate therapeutic interventions and by the type of toxin. The potential causes of altered consciousness are many and may reflect systemic illness, isolated organ system dysfunction, drug intoxications or withdrawal, psychiatric illness, or neurologic disease. In this article, a comprehensive approach to patients with altered consciousness and suspected poisoning is discussed. This survey, however, does not intend to be a substitute for the need for consultation with a clinical toxicologist qualified in the diagnosis and treatment of poisoned patients. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Psilocybin dose-dependently causes delayed, transient headaches in healthy volunteers

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Background: Psilocybin is a well-characterized classic hallucinogen (psychedelic) with a long history of religious use by indigenous cultures, and nonmedical use in modern societies. Although psilocybin is structurally related to migraine medications, and case studies suggest that psilocybin may be efficacious in treatment of cluster headache, little is known about the relationship between psilocybin and headache. Methods: This double-blind study examined a broad range of psilocybin doses (0, 5, 10, 20, and 30. mg/70. kg) on headache in 18 healthy participants. Results: Psilocybin frequently caused headache, the incidence, duration, and severity of which increased in a dose-dependent manner. All headaches had delayed onset, were transient, and lasted no more than a day after psilocybin administration. Conclusions: Possible mechanisms for these observations are discussed, and include induction of delayed headache through nitric oxide release. These data suggest that headache is an adverse event to be expected with the nonmedical use of psilocybin-containing mushrooms as well as the administration of psilocybin in human research. Headaches were neither severe nor disabling, and should not present a barrier to future psilocybin research. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - Nanowired drug delivery for neuroprotection in central nervous system injuries: Modulation by environmental temperature, intoxication of nanoparticles, and comorbidity factors
A1  - Sharma H.S.
A1  - Sharma A. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Recent developments in nanomedicine resulted in targeted drug delivery of active compounds into the central nervous system (CNS) either through encapsulated material or attached to nanowires. Nanodrug delivery by any means is supposed to enhance neuroprotection due to rapid accumulation of drugs within the target area and a slow metabolism of the compound. These two factors enhance neuroprotection than the conventions drug delivery. However, this is still uncertain whether nanodrug delivery could alter the pharmacokinetics of compounds making it more effective or just longer exposure of the compound for extended period of time is primarily responsible for enhanced effects of the drugs. Our laboratory is engaged in understanding of the nanodrug delivery using TiO2 nanowires in CNS injuries models, for example, spinal cord injury (SCI), hyperthermia and/or intoxication of nanoparticles with or without other comorbidity factors, that is, diabetes or hypertension in rat models. Our observations suggest that nanowired drug delivery is effective under normal situation of SCI and hyperthermia as evidenced by significant reduction in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, brain edema formation, cognitive disturbances, neuronal damages, and brain pathologies. However, when the pathophysiology of these CNS injuries is aggravated by nanoparticles intoxication or comorbidity factors, adjustment in dosage of nanodrug delivery is needed. This indicates that further research in nanomedicine is needed to explore suitable strategies in achieving greater neuroprotection in CNS injury in combination with nanoparticles intoxication or other comorbidity factors for better clinical practices. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Background: Psilocybin is a classic psychedelic drug that has a history of use in psychotherapy. One of the rationales for its use was that it aids emotional insight by lowering psychological defences. Aims: To test the hypothesis that psilocybin facilitates access to personal memories and emotions by comparing subjective and neural responses to positive autobiographical memories under psilocybin and placebo. Method: Ten healthy participants received two functional magnetic resonance imaging scans (2mg intravenous psilocybin v. intravenous saline), separated by approximately 7 days, during which they viewed two different sets of 15 positive autobiographical memory cues. Participants viewed each cue for 6 s and then closed their eyes for 16 s and imagined re-experiencing the event. Activations during this recollection period were compared with an equivalent period of eyes-closed rest. We split the recollection period into an early phase (first 8 s) and a late phase (last 8 s) for analysis. Results: Robust activations to the memories were seen in limbic and striatal regions in the early phase and the medial prefrontal cortex in the late phase in both conditions (P<0.001, whole brain cluster correction), but there were additional visual and other sensory cortical activations in the late phase under psilocybin that were absent under placebo. Ratings of memory vividness and visual imagery were significantly higher after psilocybin (P<0.05) and there was a significant positive correlation between vividness and subjective well-being at follow-up (P<0.01). Conclusions: Evidence that psilocybin enhances autobiographical recollection implies that it may be useful in psychotherapy either as a tool to facilitate the recall of salient memories or to reverse negative cognitive biases.

N2  - Psychotomimetics like the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine and the 5-hydroxytryptamine2A receptor (5-HT 2A R) agonist psilocybin induce psychotic symptoms in healthy volunteers that resemble those of schizophrenia. Recent theories of psychosis posit that aberrant encoding of prediction errors (PE) may underlie the expression of psychotic symptoms. This study used a roving mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm to investigate whether the encoding of PE is affected by pharmacological manipulation of NMDAR or 5-HT 2A R, and whether the encoding of PE under placebo can be used to predict drug-induced symptoms. Using a double-blind within-subject placebo-controlled design, S-ketamine and psilocybin, respectively, were administrated to two groups of healthy subjects. Psychological alterations were assessed using a revised version of the Altered States of Consciousness (ASC-R) questionnaire. As an index of PE, we computed changes in MMN amplitudes as a function of the number of preceding standards (MMN memory trace effect) during a roving paradigm. S-ketamine, but not psilocybin, disrupted PE processing as expressed by a frontally disrupted MMN memory trace effect. Although both drugs produced positive-like symptoms, the extent of PE processing under placebo only correlated significantly with the severity of cognitive impairments induced by S-ketamine. Our results suggest that the NMDAR, but not the 5-HT 2A R system, is implicated in PE processing during the MMN paradigm, and that aberrant PE signaling may contribute to the formation of cognitive impairments. The assessment of the MMN memory trace in schizophrenia may allow detecting early phases of the illness and might also serve to assess the efficacy of novel pharmacological treatments, in particular of cognitive impairments. © 2012 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

N2  - Confirmation of identity of forensically relevant compounds, such as drugs of abuse, is a necessary step in medico-legal event controls of people involved in crimes, workplace accidents and driving under the influence of drugs (DUID). Plasma is a useful medium in determining the short-term use of illicit drugs and its analysis is mandatory in the case of DUID in many countries. Urine has been the sample of choice for monitoring drug abuses in workplaces and is subjective to strict regulations. The aim of this work was the development of a fast and reliable confirmatory method for the determination of multiple drugs of abuse belonging to different chemical and toxicological classes: amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, methylenedioxyethylamphetamine, methylenedioxymethylamphetamine, cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ketamine, phencyclidine, psilocybin and mescaline. The procedure involves very rapid steps of sample preparation with use of automated micro-SPE. The quantitative analysis is performed by LC-ESI-MS/MS with chromatographic Core ShellTM column. The method has been fully validated according to SOFT-AAFS guidelines and applied as confirmatory analysis for real samples coming from agro-industry employees. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Rationale: Although reports of dextromethorphan (DXM) abuse have increased recently, few studies have examined the effects of high doses of DXM. Objective: This study in humans evaluated the effects of supratherapeutic doses of DXM and triazolam. Methods: Single, acute oral doses of DXM (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 mg/70 kg), triazolam (0.25 and 0.5 mg/70 kg), and placebo were administered to 12 healthy volunteers with histories of hallucinogen use, under double-blind conditions, using an ascending dose run-up design. Subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects were assessed repeatedly after drug administration for 6 h. Results: Triazolam produced dose-related increases in subject-rated sedation, observer-rated sedation, and behavioral impairment. DXM produced a profile of dose-related physiological and subjective effects differing from triazolam. DXM effects included increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and emesis; increases in observer-rated effects typical of classic hallucinogens (e.g., distance from reality, visual effects with eyes open and closed, joy, anxiety); and participant ratings of stimulation (e.g., jittery, nervous), somatic effects (e.g., tingling, headache), perceptual changes, end-of-session drug liking, and mystical-type experience. After 400 mg/70 kg DXM, 11 of 12 participants indicated on a pharmacological class questionnaire that they thought they had received a classic hallucinogen (e.g., psilocybin). Drug effects resolved without significant adverse effects by the end of the session. In a 1-month follow-up, volunteers attributed increased spirituality and positive changes in attitudes, moods, and behavior to the session experiences. Conclusions: High doses of DXM produced effects distinct from triazolam and had characteristics that were similar to the classic hallucinogen psilocybin. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Background: Clinical research on classic hallucinogens in treatment of addiction was halted abruptly in the early 1970s, and is only now resuming. The purpose of this presentation is to 1) review past clinical trials of classic hallucinogens for addiction 2) discuss possible mechanisms of action, and 3) present design and preliminary results of two ongoing pilot studies of psilocybin in the treatment of nicotine and alcohol dependence. Methods: A review was conducted of published controlled trials of classic hallucinogens for treatment of addictions. In addition, a broader literature review aimed to identify possible psychological and biological mechanisms of action. Current open-label trials are investigating effects of psilocybin on nicotine dependence and alcohol dependence. The Johns Hopkins smoking cessation study includes 3 psilocybin sessions at 4-week intervals in doses of 20- 30 mg/70 kg, combined with cognitive behavioral smoking cessation treatment. The UNM alcohol dependence study includes 2 psilocybin sessions one month apart, at doses of 0.3-0.4 mg/kg, combined with motivational enhancement therapy. Results: Numerous studies in the 1960s and early 1970s investigated the use of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism. A recent meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials of LSD administered in a single high dose for treatment of alcoholism (total n=536) demonstrated that the overall effect size of LSD treatment was substantial and highly consistent across studies, with an odds ratio for post-treatment improvement of 1.96 (95% CI 1.36-2.84). Trials investigating other classic hallucinogens and other addictions had methodological problems that limit confidence in their findings. The psychedelic model hypothesized that an overwhelming "peak-psychedelic" or mystical experience could bring about lasting change in personality and addictive behavior. Although this mechanism has not been demonstrated directly in addiction trials, the hypothesis is consistent with data including 1) effects of psilocybin in normal participants; 2) qualitative and quantitative research on transformative/mystical experiences leading to abstinence in addicts; and 3) decreases in substance use among members of religions that use classic hallucinogens sacra mentally. Although basic research on anti-addictive effects of classic hallucinogens is lacking, 5HT2A receptor-mediated increases in expression of BDNF and GDNF are potentially relevant to changes in substance use behavior. In the Johns Hopkins smoking cessation study, four participants have been treated to date. Acute effects of psilocybin were similar to those reported previously in normal volunteers, with all four volunteers showing substantial mystical content in one or more of the sessions. Adverse events included transient anxiety which was well managed with interpersonal support. On no session was pharmacologic intervention required, and any anxiety resolved by the end of all sessions. All participants showed biologically confirmed abstinence use to 6 months (4 participants up to the final 1 year follow up). Recruitment began in February 2012 for the UNM alcohol dependence study. An update on study progress and outcomes will be presented. Conclusions: Past clinical trials of LSD in treatment of alcoholism, several other lines of supportive evidence concerning hallucinogen effects and models of addiction, and the preliminary results of ongoing pilot studies provide a convincing rationale for further investigation of clinical effects of psilocybin on addictive behaviors.

N2  - Background: From the late 1950s to the early 1970s clinical research was conducted exploring the use of hallucinogens to treat the existential anxiety, despair and isolation often associated with advanced-stage cancer. These reports described critically ill individuals undergoing psycho spiritual epiphanies, frequently with sustained improvement in anxiety, mood and quality of life. While these promising investigations were halted because of political and cultural pressures, after a thirty year hiatus the development of hallucinogen treatment research for patients with anxiety reactive to advanced-stage cancer has resumed. Methods: This presentation examines the rationale, methodology and results of a pilot investigation using psilocybin to treat the existential anxiety associated with advanced-stage cancer. Psilocybin, the active alkaloid in hallucinogenic mushrooms and a 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C agonist, was administered to 12 screened subjects diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. A double-blind, placebo-controlled methodology was employed, utilizing a moderate dosage of psilocybin, 0.2 mg/kg. Treatment sessions were conducted on the Clinical Research Unit at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Results: Safe physiological and psychological responses were documented during treatment sessions. There were no clinically significant adverse events with psilocybin. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory trait anxiety subscale demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety at 1 and 3 months after treatment. The Beck Depression Inventory revealed an improvement of mood that reached significance at 6 months; the Profile of Mood States identified mood improvement after treatment with psilocybin that approached but did not reach significance. Conclusions: This study establishes the feasibility and safety of administering moderate doses of psilocybin to patients with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. Some of the data revealed a positive trend toward improved mood and anxiety. These results support the need for more research in this long-neglected field. To that end, two new studies using psilocybin to treat cancer anxiety, at Johns Hopkins and New York University, are currently on-going. Both of these investigations are evaluating higher doses than used in the Harbor-UCLA study, allowing for greater exploration of the role of psycho-spiritual or transcendent states of consciousness in facilitating therapeutic outcomes.

T1  - Experimental studies of psilocybin in healthy volunteers: Persisting attribution of positive changes in attitudes, mood and behavior

N2  - Background: Clinical research with psilocybin in the 1950s and 60s showed that psilocybin often produced widely variable subjective experiences. This presentation will present recent and ongoing research at Johns Hopkins demonstrating that, in well-prepared and interpersonally support participants, psilocybin can occasion, in most volunteers studied, experiences rated by volunteers as among the most personally meaningful of their lives. Methods: Fifty-four healthy volunteers (mean age=46 years; 56% female) without histories of hallucinogen use were recruited from the local community for participation in two double-blind studies comparing either psilocybin to methylphenidate, or comparing a range of doses of psilocybin to placebo. To develop rapport and trust during the psilocybin sessions, they met with study monitors for 8 hours of contact time before the first session. Two to five 8-hr sessions were separated by 1-2 month intervals. During sessions, volunteers used eyeshades and were instructed to direct their attention inward. Volunteers completed questionnaires assessing effects immediately after and 1-2 months after sessions, and at 14 months follow-up. Community observers were interviewed before and after sessions about observed changes in the volunteers' behavior. Results: Psilocybin produced acute perceptual and subjective effects including, strong or extreme anxiety/fear sometime during the session (33% of volunteers at 30 mg/70 kg) and/or mystical-type experience (65% of volunteers at 20 or 30 mg/70 kg). One month after sessions at the two highest doses, volunteers rated the psilocybin experience as having substantial personal and spiritual significance, and attributed to the experience sustained positive changes in attitudes, mood, and behavior. At 14 months, ratings were undiminished and were consistent with changes rated by community observers. Both the acute and persisting effects of psilocybin were generally a monotonically increasing function of dose, with the lowest dose (5 mg/70 kg) showing significant effects. The results of the dose-effect study suggested that an ascending psilocybin dose sequence is somewhat more likely than a descending sequence to produce long-lasting positive changes in attitudes, mood, and behavior. Conclusions: In conclusion, recently completed and ongoing studies show that, when administered to healthy volunteers under supportive conditions, psilocybin occasioned experiences similar to spontaneously- occurring mystical or insightful experiences and which were evaluated by volunteers and community observers as having produced substantial and sustained positive changes in attitudes, moods, and behavior. The ability to prospectively occasion such experiences permits rigorous scientific investigations about their causes and consequences, insights into underlying pharmacological and brain mechanisms, and the investigation of possible therapeutic applications.

T1  - A comparative review of the neuro-psychopharmacology of hallucinogen-induced altered states of consciousness: The uniqueness of some hallucinogens
A1  - Sayin U. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Altered states of consciousness induced by hallucinogens (H-ASC) is still a vaguely understood phenomenon. Taken the diverse psychological effects they exert, the main mechanism of action of hallucinogens; LSD, ibogaine, THC, PCP, MDMA, methamphetamine, mescaline, psilocybin and DMT, of which psychological effects are discussed in the article, are not properly understood and explained by the modern methods of neuroscience due to the lack of vigorous research. The involvement of some receptors, such as, 5-HT2 (and probably other 5-HT receptors), glutamate and dopamine receptors, adrenergic and cannabinoid receptors, is one of the mechanisms, however it is not easy to explain such incongruent psychological effects by only receptor and neurotransmitter systems alone, since H-ASCs have, sometimes, their own unity and gestalt, unfolding the subconscious, in the "voyages" they induce, although the perception may, or may not, be distorted depending on the person, and "set and setting". They induce visual, tactile and auditory hallucinations; synesthesia; perception of fractals, geometrical and kaleidoscopic images with vivid colors; perception of two dimensional pictures as three dimensional, animated and moving; distortions and alterations in the body perception; alterations in the perceptions of temporal-spatial continuum and time; changes in the perception of the ego and the self; feelings of unification with nature and universe, peak experiences - mimicking satori or nirvana-, ecstasy, rapture, extreme euphoria, excitement and happiness, oceanic bliss, self-fulfillment, referred as "good trip", as well as, dysphoria, anxiety, mania, delirium, psychosis, acute schizophrenia, collapse of the self, known as "bad trip"; depending upon the mood, affection and psychology of the person, and "set and setting". Mysticomimetic effects of H-ASCs, imitate the consciousness states of ancient mystics, probably, by means of activating prefrontal cortex, limbic system and the right temporal lobe. A hypothetical "holographic brain theory" may give some extra insights about the explanation of some of the effects of H-ASCs. It should be taken into account that H-ASCs, can be accepted as a good tool to investigate the nature of consciousness, brain and the human psyche, as well as some of the H-ASCs are good models of psychosis, too. More detailed scientific research should be performed to understand the basic and real mechanisms of H-ASCs, to comprehend and unravel the mystery of human mind and consciousness, since scientific medical research on hallucinogens has been legalized since 1992.

N2  - The goal of this paper is to both understand and depathologize clinically significant mental distress related to criminalized contact with psychoactive biotic substances by employing a framework known as critical political ecology of health and disease from the subdiscipline of medical geography. The political ecology of disease framework joins disease ecology with the power-calculus of political economy and calls for situating health-related phenomena in their broad social and economic context, demonstrating how large-scale global processes are at work at the local level, and giving due attention to historical analysis in understanding the relevant human-environment relations. Critical approaches to the political ecology of health and disease have the potential to incorporate ever-broadening social, political, economic, and cultural factors to challenge traditional causes, definitions, and sociomedical understandings of disease. Inspired by the patient-centered medical diagnosis critiques in medical geography, this paper will use a critical political ecology of disease approach to challenge certain prevailing sociomedical interpretations of disease, or more specifically, mental disorder, found in the field of substance abuse diagnostics and the related American punitive public policy regimes of substance abuse prevention and control, with regards to the use of biotic substances. It will do this by first critically interrogating the concept of "substances" and grounding them in an ecological context, reviewing the history of both the development of modern substance control laws and modern substance abuse diagnostics, and understanding the biogeographic dimensions of such approaches. It closes with proposing a non-criminalizing public health approach for regulating human close contact with psychoactive substances using the example of cannabis use. © 2012 Aggarwal et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Case report. We report a case of psilocybin toxicity, causing an anticholinergic syndrome, after the consumption of Psilocybe Mexicana, a serotonergic mushroom. The patient was unconscious on admission to hospital, with mydriasis, hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotension and respiratory failure after using cannabis all day and a portion of 'magic mushrooms' in addition to his regular medication which included GABAergic and anticholinergic drugs. The presence of psilocin (in serum) and cannabis (in urine) was confirmed. The patient was admitted to the ICU, treated with supportive care and was discharged after two days. Conclusion. Anticholinergic toxicity can occur when anticholinergic and GABAergic drugs are combined with cannabis and Psilocybe Mexicana and may result in life-threatening organ failure. © 2012, Nederlandse Vereniging voor Intensive Care.

T1  - Hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of ayahuasca in the treatment of addictions
A1  - Liester M.B.
A1  - Prickett J.I. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Ayahuasca is a medicinal plant mixture utilized by indigenous peoples throughout the Amazon River basin for healing purposes. The "vine of the soul" or "vine of death," as it is known in South America, contains a combination of monoamine oxidase inhibitors and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). When ingested together, these medicines produce profound alterations in consciousness. Increasingly, ayahuasca is being utilized to treat addictions. However, the mechanism of action by which ayahuasca treats addictions remains unclear. We offer four hypotheses to explain possible biochemical, physiological, psychological, and transcendent mechanisms by which ayahuasca may exert its anti-addiction effects. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - A liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry method for the quantitation of psilocin in plasma is presented. Sample workup was performed with mixed-mode solid-phase extraction using ascorbic acid and nitrogen for drying to protect the unstable analyte. Calibration curves were linear from 2 to 100 ng/mL, and no selectivity problems occurred. The limit of detection was 0.1 ng/mL, and the limit of quantitation was 0.34 ng/mL. Recovery was >86% and matrix effects were <110%. Both were reproducible. Interday and intraday precisions at different concentrations were 1.5-4.3% relative standard deviation, bias within +/-9%. Processed samples were stable in the autosampler for at least 26 h. Furthermore, the stability of psilocin in blood stored at different temperatures over various periods of time was investigated. Samples stored at room temperature showed a continuous decrease of analyte leading to a loss of about 90% after 1 week. Storage in the fridge improved sample stability significantly. Freezing of blood samples led to a not reproducible loss of psilocin.

T1  - Moral transhumanism: the next step
A1  - Tennison M.N. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Although transhumanism offers hope for the transcendence of human biological limitations, it generates many intrinsic and consequential ethical concerns. The latter include issues such as the exacerbation of social inequalities and the exponentially increasing technological capacity to cause harm. To mitigate these risks, many thinkers have initiated investigations into the possibility of moral enhancement that could limit the power disparities facilitated by biotechnological enhancement. The arguments often focus on whether moral enhancement is morally permissible, or even obligatory, and remain largely in the realm of the hypothetical. This paper proposes that psilocybin may represent a viable, practical option for moral enhancement and that its further research in the context of moral psychology could comprise the next step in the development of moral transhumanism.

T1  - Antipsychotic treatment in OCD
A1  - Al Moumen M.H. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Due to the phenotypical heterogeneity of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and its subtypes, and due to the high rate of co-morbid psychopathology, it remains a challenge to treat OCD using medication effectively, behavioral therapy and cognitive therapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line pharmacotherapy treatments OCD, but up to 50% of patients do not respond to initialtreatment of OCD. Therefore, treatment options for non-respondersinclude augmentation of antidepressantswith antipsychotics and other medications.

N2  - Objective: Serotonergic hallucinogens such as psilocybin produce positive-like symptoms and perceptual disturbances including visual hallucinations and deficits in visual contour processing that are reminiscent to that observed in some patients in early or acute stages of schizophrenia. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms and 5-HT receptor sites that mediate these visual perceptual alterations remain largely unknown. Methods: To further elucidate the role of 5-HT2A receptors in visual processing, we performed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial in healthy human subjects (n=20) to assess the effects of psilocybin (215 mg/kg p.o.), on prestimulus and subsequent visual stimulus-induced parieto-occipital alpha oscillations and early visual-evoked potentials and to determine whether these psilocybin-induced effects are (II) reversed by the preferential 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (50 mg p.o.) or the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone. Results: Analysis of the visual-evoked potentials revealed that psilocybin selectively increased the medial P1 potential, whereas ketanserin selectively decreased the medial P1 potential. The subsequent N170 potential was strongly decreased over the lateral occipital cortex by psilocybin and associated with the appearance of visual hallucinations and audiovisual synesthesia, both of which were completely blocked by the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin. A correlational analysis showed that the decease the N170 potential correlated with the intensity of psilocybin-induced subjective alterations in visual perceptions. In contrast to this, the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone did only moderately reduced psilocybin-induced visual disturbances and partially reversed the reduction in the N170 potential. Conclusion: The present results show that 5-HT2A rather than 5-HT1A receptor stimulation is the key mechanism for the generation of visual hallucinations and audiovisual synesthesia in psilocybin states and suggests that such a mechanism may also be responsible for the visual disturbances observed in early schizophrenia and/or Parkinson's disease.

N2  - Objective: Traditionally, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were thought to function as monomeric units. However, over the past few years, GPCRs have been shown to be located in close molecular proximity at the plasma membrane in living mammalian cells, implying the existence of dimers or even higher-order oligomers. The neurotransmitters serotonin and glutamate both have been the target of considerable attention regarding psychosis and antipsychotic drug development. Atypical antipsychotics, such as clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone, all have in common a high affinity to block the function of the 5-HT2A receptor. The psychoactive effects of hallucinogenic 5-HT2A receptor agonists, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin, share several features with schizophrenia, including perceptual disturbances and alterations in cognition and mood. A new class of potential antipsychotic drugs acting as agonists at metabotropic glutamate 2/3 (mGlu2/3) receptors has recently received attention in preclinical and clinical studies. Methods: We used biophysical assays to characterize the oligomerization of 5-HT2A and mGlu2 receptors, and mouse behavior models to determine the molecular mechanisms contributing to antipsychotic efficacy. Results: We found that 5-HT2A and mGlu2 receptors form a GPCR heterocomplex in tissue culture and mouse frontal cortex. Our results suggest that the 5-HT2A-mGlu2 receptor heterocomplex is necessary for the cellular and behavioral responses induced by hallucinogenic and antipsychotic drugs. Conclusion: These observations provide a mechanistic insight into antipsychotic action.

N2  - Introduction: "Magic mushrooms" is the most common name given to hallucinogenic fungi containing the psychoactive alkaloids psilocybin and psilocin. In recent years, "magic truffles" have become a new form of supply of psychoactive Psilocybe alkaloids, since Psilocybe sclerotia are not specifically included in the laws banning the sale, the purchase and the use of such substances and mushrooms containing them. Methods: A liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the rapid determination of psilocybin and psilocin in Psilocybe sclerotia. Following a simple step extraction with methanol, the alkaloids were separated on a reversed-phase column using a gradient of 0.1% formic acid - acetonitrile s a mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Separated analytes were detected by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in the positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring. Results: The developed method was linear over the calibration range for all two substances under investigation, with a r2 0.99. The detection and quantification limits were 0.3mg and 1mg per 100mg truffles, for both psilocin and psilocybin and the intra-and inter-day coefficients of variation were always better than 15%. Using this method, the presence of only psilocybin was demonstrated in examined Psilocybe sclerotia. The content of psilocybin was found to vary over a concentration range of 59.3 to 167.8 mg per 100 mg truffles corresponding to 0.06-0.16% alkaloid per fresh sclerotia. Conclusion: The results of our analyses can be an incentive for the policy makers to include Psilocybe sclerotia in the list of controlled plants or herbal products that contain psychotropic alkaloids in the corresponding laws banning the sale, the purchase and the use of illegal drugs in European and non European Countries.

N2  - Objective: To assess the epidemiology of mushroom poisoning in the United Kingdom between January 2008 and 14th November 2011. Methods: Enquiries to the National Poisons Information service were reviewed retrospectively and analysed to evaluate patterns of exposure. Results: A total of 946 enquiries were analysed; this accounted for 0.4%, 0.37%, 0.63% and 0.52% of all enquiries in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 respectively. Fifty-four percent (n = 515) of the total involved children under 15 years and 45% (424) involved children < 5 years. In this group 81% were reported to have ingested an unidentified mushroom; 77% were asymptomatic, 12% reported gastrointestinal symptoms only and 4 cases developed moderate features. Eighty-four percent of all enquiries occurred between June and November (peak in September) indicating a possible influence of climatic conditions on growth. Enquiries that reported symptoms either at time of enquiry or at follow-up were reviewed to determine the time of onset of symptoms. Of these (n = 332) 126 were excluded due to insufficient detail on the record or unconfirmed exposure. In the remaining 206 enquiries, 72% reported symptoms within the first 6 hours with 28% reporting later onset of symptoms. In the under 5 age group who reported symptoms only 34 enquiries contained sufficient data to determine time of onset and in that group only 2 developed features later than 6 hours post ingestion. None of those followed up developed severe features. Forty (5%) cases had a poisoning severity score of moderate or severe. In this group 21 were regarding an unknown species, 9 concerned psilocybin or magic mushrooms and the other 10 were regarding known species of mushroom including Amanita and Cortinarius species. Conclusion: Seasonal poisoning is not a new phenomenon; the suggestion that availability is a major determinant in the risk of poisoning particularly in children is supported by these data. Foragers and pickers who consume larger quantities of mushrooms tend to develop more severe symptoms. Education of the public concerning consumption of mushrooms and education of health personnel regarding early treatment and transfer to hospitals with appropriate facilities are important for improving outcome.

N2  - Mescaline, phencyclidine (PCP) and psilocybin are potent hallucinogenic drugs strongly affecting both human and animal behavior. However, these compounds have not been previously investigated in zebrafish (Danio rerio), rapidly gaining popularity as a model in psychopharmacology research. Here, we examine the effects of mescaline, PCP and psilocybin in multiple behavioral paradigms. Mescaline (10-20 mg/L) generally displayed an anxiolytic effect in the novel tank test, while PCP (1-3 mg/L) reduced freezing behavior and elicited a pattern of erratic swimming. Mescaline-treated fish markedly increased shoaling behavior and altered movement patterns in the open field test. Additionally, mescaline and PCP disrupted normal zebrafish exploratory behavior, as assessed by ethograms. Psilocybin at doses tested (0.5-3 mg/L) was inactive in all of the behavioral tests. Interestingly, both psilocybin and PCP raised whole-body cortisol levels without affecting brain c-fos expression, and mescaline did not alter cortisol or c-fos levels. Overall, this confirms the high sensitivity of zebrafish models to various hallucinogenic compounds with complex behavioral and physiological profiles.

N2  - Background: There have been neither national multiyear analyses of mushroom ingestions handled by poison control centers (PCCs), nor spatial analyses of these ingestions. Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of mushroom ingestion calls to PCCs. To perform a GIS/Spatial Epidemiology analysis of mushroom ingestion calls. Methods: A retrospective analysis of PCC call data. NPDS database search was performed, from 2001-2011 with matching mushroom codes. Demographics, toxin group, specifi c species ingested, clinical outcome, treatment location, and caller zip code were identified. Descriptive analysis was performed with Excel and Stata; Spatial analysis was performed with SaTScan and ArcGIS. Results: 83140 mushroom ingestions were reported to US PCCs from 2001-2011. 64534 (77.6%) were pediatric ingestions and 48437 (58.3%) were under 6 years old. 48423 (58.2%) of patients were male. 65255 (78.5%) of ingestions were unintentional. Identification was made in only 4232 (5.1%) exposures and included 185 distinct species. The 5 most common species (number of Identifications): 1. Morchella angusticeps (507) 2. Chlorophyllum molybdites (374) 3. Amanita muscaria (319) 4. Lycoperdon candidum (228) 5. Calvatia lepidophora (175). The toxin group was identified in 12147 (14.6%) of ingestions. The toxin groups (number of Identifications) were: 1. Cyclopeptides (512) 1a. Orellanine (41) 2. Muscimol (Ibotenic Acid) (480) 3. Monomethylhydrazine (MMH) (448) 4. Muscarine and Histamine (284) 5. Coprine (141) 6. Hallucinogenics (Psilocybin and Psilocin) (8375). 7. Gastrointestinal Irritants (1866). Of the symptomatic cases, effects were minor in 10953 (56.5%), moderate in 7804 (40.3%), major in 568 (2.9%), and death in 45 (0.2%). Of the 614 cases of major effect or death, a species was identified in 64 (10.4%). The 5 most common species (number of cases) identified as responsible for major effects or death were: Amanita phalloides (27), Amanita muscaria (22), Amanita pantherina (9), Amanita Smithiana/Proxima/Pseudoporphyria (5), & Amanita bisporigera (3). Of the 97 cases where Amanita phalloides was identified, 23 (23.7%) resulted in major effects and 4 (4.1%) in death. In the 59 cases of Amanita phalloides ingestions where clinical effects were confirmed, 23 (39.0%) resulted in major effects and 4 (6.8%) in death. Maps demonstrating ingestion broken down by species of interest, toxin group, and clinical effects will be presented. Conclusions: Calls to US PCCs regarding mushroom ingestions occur commonly. However, the mushroom species or toxin group is infrequently identified. Major effects or death are rare, but symptomatic Amanita phalloides ingestions appear to be at the highest risk.

T1  - GPCR oligomers in pharmacology and signaling
A1  - Gonzalez-Maeso J. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent one of the largest families of cell surface receptors, and are the target of more than half of the current therapeutic drugs on the market. When activated by an agonist, the GPCR undergoes conformational changes that facilitate its interaction with heterotrimeric G proteins, which then relay signals to downstream intracellular effectors. Although GPCRs were thought to function as monomers, many studies support the hypothesis that G protein coupling involves the formation of GPCR homo- and/or hetero-complexes. These complex systems have been suggested to exhibit specific signaling cascades, pharmacological, internalization, and recycling properties. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the structure, function and dynamics of GPCR complexes, as well as the findings obtained in animal models. © 2011 Gonzalez-Maeso; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

T1  - Iconography in Bradshaw rock art: Breaking the circularity
A1  - Pettigrew J. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Background: Interpreting the symbols found in the rock art of an extinct culture is hampered by the fact that such symbols are culturally determined. How does one break the circularity inherent in the fact that the knowledge of both the symbols and the culture comes from the same source? In this study, the circularity is broken for the Bradshaw rock art of the Kimberley by seeking anchors from outside the culture. Methods: Bradshaw rock art in the Kimberley region of Australia and Sandawe rock art in the Kolo region of Eastern Tanzania were surveyed in six visits on foot, by vehicle, by helicopter and from published or shared images, as well as from the published and online images of Khoisan rock art. Results: Uniquely shared images between Bradshaw and Sandawe art, such as the 'mushroom head' symbol of psilocybin use, link the two cultures and indicate that they were shamanistic. Therefore, many mysterious features in the art can be understood in terms of trance visualisations. A number of other features uniquely link Bradshaw and Sandawe cultures, such as a special affinity for small mammals. There are also many references to baobabs in early Bradshaw art but not later. This can be explained in the context of the Toba super-volcano, the likely human transport of baobabs to the Kimberley and the extraordinary utility of the baobab. Conclusion: Many more mysterious symbols in Bradshaw rock art might await interpretation using the approaches adopted here. © 2011 Optometrists Association Australia.

T1  - Serotonergic agents in the management of cluster headache
A1  - Lambru G.
A1  - Matharu M. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Cluster headache is a highly disabling primary headache disorder, characterized by unilateral headache attacks occurring in association with cranial autonomic symptoms. Serotonergic agents, such as the ergot alkaloids, have traditionally been used for the acute and preventive treatment of cluster headache and other primary headaches. Although it initially was thought that their efficacy was due solely to the vasoconstriction of extracranial cerebral vessels, new mechanisms of action of these drugs have been ascertained as a consequence of advances in elucidation of the pathogenesis of primary headaches and the development of triptans. This article reviews the current knowledge about serotonergic agonists and antagonists used in the management of cluster headache, focusing on their mechanisms of action and on the possible role of serotonin system dysfunction in this complex disorder. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

T1  - Heaven and hell-a phenomenological study of recreational use of 4-HO-MET in Sweden
A1  - Kjellgren A.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The psychoactive substance 4-HO-MET (4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine) with psychedelic qualities is one of many legal so-called Internet drugs. The aim of this qualitative study was to establish an understanding of what characterizes its recreational use. Very little is known about the effects of this substance. Twenty-five anonymous Swedish experience reports (from persons aged 18-30 years) from public Internet forums were analyzed using the Empirical Phenomenological Psychological Method. The analysis produced 37 categories that were compiled into nine general themes: (1) motivation, preparation and expectation; (2) initial effects; (3) change of perception; (4) unfiltered awareness and intensified flow of information; (5) lateral cognition; (6) border between subject and object is erased; (7) heaven; (8) hell; and (9) subsiding effects. An understanding of the chronological happenings, called The Process, appeared out of the general structure. Drastic changes in cognitive, emotional and bodily functions were described. The motivation for use seemed to be driven by a strong curiosity. The experiences shifted between "heaven" and "hell," but participants appeared satisfied and ready to repeat the experience. The experiences described show great similarity with classic psychedelic substances as LSD or psilocybin. More research is needed about health hazards or possible therapeutic potentials. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

T1  - Voice of the psychonauts: Coping, life purpose, and spirituality in psychedelic drug users

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Psychoactive drug use shows great diversity, but due to a disproportionate focus on problematic drug use, predominant nonproblematic drug use remains an understudied phenomenon. Historic and anecdotal evidence shows that natural sources of "psychedelic" drugs (e.g., mescaline and psilocybin) have been used in religious and spiritual settings for centuries, as well as for psychological self-enhancement purposes. Our study assessed a total of 667 psychedelic drug users, other drug users, and drug nonusers by online questionnaires. Coping, life purpose, and spirituality were measured with the Psychological Immune Competence Inventory, the Purpose in Life test, and the Intrinsic Spirituality Scale, respectively. Results indicate that the use of psychedelic drugs with a purpose to enhance self-knowledge is less associated with problems, and correlates positively with coping and spirituality. Albeit the meaning of "spirituality" may be ambiguous, it seems that a spiritually-inclined attitude in drug use may act as a protective factor against drug-related problems. The autognostic use of psychedelic drugs may be thus hypothesized as a "training situation" that promotes self-enhancement by rehearsing personal coping strategies and by gaining self-knowledge. However, to assess the actual efficiency and the speculated long-term benefits of these deliberately provoked exceptional experiences, further qualitative investigations are needed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

T1  - Psychedelic drugs, Hippie counterculture, speed and phenobarbital treatment of sedative-hypnotic dependence: A journey to the Haight Ashbury in the sixties
A1  - Wesson D.R. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The 1960s were a time of social upheaval, wars, vibrant creativity and missed opportunity. Mainstream culture and a psychedelic drug-using counterculture shared a belief in "better living through chemistry," but they disagreed about the particular chemistry. The Vietnam war and the cold war with the Soviet Union, racial discrimination, and gender roles fueled political activism. "Yes we can" was not a slogan of the time but political activists clearly believed they could change the beliefs, attitudes and behavior of mainstream culture; and they did. Hippie counterculture on the other hand was largely alienated and strove primarily to develop a separate culture with its own mores, beliefs and lifestyles. Although there was some overlap between hippies and activists, hippies didn't generally have the same sense of political empowerment. Hippie enclaves developed in New York; Boston; Seattle; Austin, Texas and elsewhere; but the epicenter was arguably the Haight-Asbury District of San Francisco. Psychedelic drugs, marijuana and the Vietnam war were among many wedge issues. This paper conjures up a personal history related to the evolution of the hippie counterculture, changing drug use patterns in the Haight-Ashbury, and the origins of a technique of withdrawing patients from barbiturates and other sedative-hypnotics using phenobarbital variously known as the Phenobarbital Withdrawal Protocol, or the "Smith and Wesson Protocol".

N2  - In forensic practice, mushroom poisonings - both accidental and those resulting from crimes and suicide attempts - are a frequently encountered type of case. In recent years, there has also been an increased interest in hallucinogenic mushrooms. Under the Act on Counteracting Drug Addiction dated July 29, 2005, possession of and trade in wild mushrooms which contain narcotic substances is a crime. Therefore, precise identification of species of fungi that contain illegal and toxic substances is very important for the purposes of judicial proceedings. Morphological analysis, a standard method for fungi species identification, does not always yield satisfactory results. Due to the reliability, speed and decreasing cost of DNA analysis, genetic methods are an interesting alternative for determining the species of biological material. Markers frequently employed in species identification of fungi are internal transcribed spacers regions (ITS1 and ITS2). The objective of a project that is being implemented at the Institute of Forensic Research is the preparation of an ITS1 and ITS2 regions sequence database of the analyzed fungal species and the validation of methods for DNA sequence analysis of these regions in the case of processed samples.

T1  - Psychedelic experience as a heuristic tool for exploring the mind and the brain
A1  - Alyushin A. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - I discuss the ontological nature and heuristic value of psychedelic experience. I argue that psychedelic phenomena may manifest the activity of certain mental formations and brain mechanisms that otherwise remain hidden. Thus, psychedelic phenomena can be heuristic tools and intriguing objects of the scientific study. I consider two types of psychedelic phenomena in particular. The first is the moral cleansing that may accompany a psychedelic trip. The second is the appearance of visual and auditory hallucinations. I establish a unified explanatory ground for the phenomena that are commonly viewed as distinct in their genesis. I explain both types of phenomena as products of the amplified imaginative ability of the brain under a substance's influence. I suggest that the activation of imagination causes an increased empathy and thus accentuates moral feelings. I propose the hypothesis that hallucinations are mental objects of a quantum nature. I argue that no ontologically separate reality stands behind psychedelic visions.

T1  - Drugs as instruments: A new framework for non-addictive psychoactive drug use
A1  - Muller C.P.
A1  - Schumann G. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Abstract Most people who are regular consumers of psychoactive drugs are not drug addicts, nor will they ever become addicts. In neurobiological theories, non-addictive drug consumption is acknowledged only as a necessary prerequisite for addiction, but not as a stable and widespread behavior in its own right. This target article proposes a new neurobiological framework theory for non-addictive psychoactive drug consumption, introducing the concept of drug instrumentalization. Psychoactive drugs are consumed for their effects on mental states. Humans are able to learn that mental states can be changed on purpose by drugs, in order to facilitate other, non-drug-related behaviors. We discuss specific instrumentalization goals and outline neurobiological mechanisms of how major classes of psychoactive drugs change mental states and serve non-drug-related behaviors. We argue that drug instrumentalization behavior may provide a functional adaptation to modern environments based on a historical selection for learning mechanisms that allow the dynamic modification of consummatory behavior. It is assumed that in order to effectively instrumentalize psychoactive drugs, the establishment of and retrieval from a drug memory is required. Here, we propose a new classification of different drug memory subtypes and discuss how they interact during drug instrumentalization learning and retrieval. Understanding the everyday utility and the learning mechanisms of non-addictive psychotropic drug use may help to prevent abuse and the transition to drug addiction in the future. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.

N2  - Context: Both hallucinogens and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine ( MDMA or "ecstasy") have direct agonistic effects on postsynaptic serotonin2A receptors, the key site for hallucinogenic actions. In addition, MDMA is a potent releaser and reuptake inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin. Objective: To assess the differential effects of MDMA and hallucinogen use on cerebral serotonin transporter (SERT) and serotonin 2A receptor binding. Design: A positron emission tomography study of 24 young adult drug users and 21 nonusing control participants performed with carbon 11 (11C)-labeled 3-amino-4-[2-[(di(methyl)amino)methyl]phenyl] sulfanylbenzonitrile (DASB) and fluorine 18 (18F)-labeled altanserin, respectively. Scans were performed in the user group after a minimum drug abstinence period of 11 days, and the group was subdivided into hallucinogen-preferring users (n=10) and MDMA-preferring users (n=14). Participants: Twenty-four young adult users ofMDMA and/or hallucinogenic drugs and 21 nonusing controls. Main Outcome Measures: In vivo cerebral SERT and serotonin2A receptor binding. Results: Compared with nonusers, MDMA-preferring users showed significant decreases in SERT nondisplaceable binding potential (neocortex, -56%; pallidostriatum, -19%; and amygdala, -32%); no significant changes were seen in hallucinogen-preferring users. Both cortical and pallidostriatal SERT nondisplaceable binding potential was negatively correlated with the number of lifetime MDMA exposures, and the time of abstinence from MDMA was positively correlated with subcortical, but not cortical, SERT binding. A small decrease in neocortical serotonin2A receptor binding in the serotonin2A receptor agonist users (both user groups) was also detected. Conclusions: We found evidence that MDMA but not hallucinogen use is associated with changes in the cerebral presynaptic serotonergic transmitter system. Because hallucinogenic drugs primarily have serotonin2A receptor agonistic actions, we conclude that the negative association between MDMA use and cerebral SERT binding is mediated through a direct presynaptic MDMA effect rather than by the serotonin2A agonistic effects of MDMA. Our cross-sectional data suggest that subcortical, but not cortical, recovery of SERT binding might take place after several months of MDMA abstinence. ©2011 American Medical Association.

N2  - Background: Ongoing psychiatric symptoms and substance use are common difficulties experienced by clients enrolled in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). However, little research to date has evaluated if specific types of current substance use are related to specific types of current psychiatric symptoms. The present study investigated these relationships with a sample of clients enrolled in a low-threshold MMT program (i.e., clients are not expelled if they continue to use substances). Some clients enrolled in low-threshold programs may never achieve complete abstinence from all substances. Thus, understanding the possibly perpetuating relationships between concurrent substance use and psychiatric symptoms is important. Understanding such relationships may aid in developing possible target areas of treatment to reduce substance use and/or related harms in this population.Methods: Seventy-seven individuals were interviewed regarding methadone usage and current and past substance use. Current psychiatric symptoms were assessed using a modified version of the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ). Relationships between types of substances used in the past 30 days and the types and number of psychiatric symptoms experienced in the same timeframe were examined.Results: The majority of participants (87.0%) reported using alcohol, illicit substances, non-prescribed prescription opioids, or non-prescribed benzodiazepines in the past 30 days and 77.9% of participants reported currently experiencing psychiatric symptoms at levels that would likely warrant diagnosis. Current non-prescribed benzodiazepine use was a predictor for increased severity (i.e., symptom count) of almost all anxiety and mood disorders assessed. Conversely, number and presence of generalized anxiety symptoms and presence of social phobia symptoms predicted current non-prescribed benzodiazepine and alcohol use, respectively.Conclusions: Individuals enrolled in the present low-threshold MMT program experience a wide variety of psychiatric symptoms and continue to use a variety of substances, including opioids. There was a particularly consistent pattern of associations between non-prescribed benzodiazepine use and a variety of psychiatric symptoms (particularly anxiety) suggesting that addressing concurrent illicit benzodiazepine use and anxiety symptoms in MMT clients warrants further clinical attention and research. © 2011 Fulton et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The present pilot study demonstrated that up to 2 mg of psilocybin delivered as a slow intravenous injection produces short-lived but typical drug effects that are psychologically and physiologically well tolerated. With appropriate care, this study supports the viability of functional magnetic resonance imaging work with psilocybin. © The Author(s) 2011 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/ journalsPermissions.nav.

T1  - Mystical experiences occasioned by the hallucinogen psilocybin lead to increases in the personality domain of openness

N2  - A large body of evidence, including longitudinal analyses of personality change, suggests that core personality traits are predominantly stable after age 30. To our knowledge, no study has demonstrated changes in personality in healthy adults after an experimentally manipulated discrete event. Intriguingly, double-blind controlled studies have shown that the classic hallucinogen psilocybin occasions personally and spiritually significant mystical experiences that predict long-term changes in behaviors, attitudes and values. In the present report we assessed the effect of psilocybin on changes in the five broad domains of personality-Neuroticism, Extroversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. Consistent with participant claims of hallucinogen-occasioned increases in aesthetic appreciation, imagination, and creativity, we found significant increases in Openness following a high-dose psilocybin session. In participants who had mystical experiences during their psilocybin session, Openness remained significantly higher than baseline more than 1 year after the session. The findings suggest a specific role for psilocybin and mystical-type experiences in adult personality change. © The Author(s) 2011 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

N2  - Psilocybin and related hallucinogenic compounds are increasingly used in human research. However, due to limited information about potential subjective side effects, the controlled medical use of these compounds has remained controversial. We therefore analysed acute, short- and long-term subjective effects of psilocybin in healthy humans by pooling raw data from eight double-blind placebo-controlled experimental studies conducted between 1999 and 2008. The analysis included 110 healthy subjects who had received 1-4 oral doses of psilocybin (45-315mug/kg body weight). Although psilocybin dose-dependently induced profound changes in mood, perception, thought and self-experience, most subjects described the experience as pleasurable, enriching and non-threatening. Acute adverse drug reactions, characterized by strong dysphoria and/or anxiety/panic, occurred only in the two highest dose conditions in a relatively small proportion of subjects. All acute adverse drug reactions were successfully managed by providing interpersonal support and did not need psychopharmacological intervention. Follow-up questionnaires indicated no subsequent drug abuse, persisting perception disorders, prolonged psychosis or other long-term impairment of functioning in any of our subjects. The results suggest that the administration of moderate doses of psilocybin to healthy, high-functioning and well-prepared subjects in the context of a carefully monitored research environment is associated with an acceptable level of risk. © The Author(s) 2011 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/ journalsPermissions.nav.

T1  - Differential contributions of serotonin receptors to the behavioral effects of indoleamine hallucinogens in mice

N2  - Psilocin (4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) is a hallucinogen that acts as an agonist at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors. Psilocin is the active metabolite of psilocybin, a hallucinogen that is currently being investigated clinically as a potential therapeutic agent. In the present investigation, we used a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to identify the serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes responsible for mediating the effects of psilocin on head twitch response (HTR) and the behavioral pattern monitor (BPM) in C57BL/6J mice. We also compared the effects of psilocin with those of the putative 5-HT2C receptor-selective agonist 1-methylpsilocin and the hallucinogen and non-selective serotonin receptor agonist 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT). Psilocin, 1-methylpsilocin, and 5-MeO-DMT induced the HTR, effects that were absent in mice lacking the 5-HT2A receptor gene. When tested in the BPM, psilocin decreased locomotor activity, holepoking, and time spent in the center of the chamber, effects that were blocked by the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 but were not altered by the selective 5-HT2C antagonist SB 242,084 or by 5-HT2A receptor gene deletion. 5-MeO-DMT produced similar effects when tested in the BPM, and the action of 5-MeO-DMT was significantly attenuated by WAY-100635. Psilocin and 5-MeO-DMT also decreased the linearity of locomotor paths, effects that were mediated by 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptors, respectively. In contrast to psilocin and 5-MeO-DMT, 1-methylpsilocin (0.6-9.6mg/kg) was completely inactive in the BPM. These findings confirm that psilocin acts as an agonist at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors in mice, whereas the behavioral effects of 1-methylpsilocin indicate that this compound is acting at 5-HT2A sites but is inactive at the 5-HT1A receptor. The fact that 1-methylpsilocin displays greater pharmacological selectivity than psilocin indicates that 1-methylpsilocin represents a potentially useful alternative to psilocybin for development as a potential therapeutic agent. © The Author(s) 2011 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

T1  - Withdrawal related adverse effects of antipsychotic medication in a patient with first-episode schizophrenia
A1  - Bartecek R.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Withdrawal-emergent adverse effects of antipsychotics are an infrequently identified condition which can appear during antipsychotic dose reduction and medication change. In this paper, we present the case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms after a dose reduction of risperidone is presented. A patient, 23 years of age, was admitted to a health care facility due to an unexpected change in his behavior, with paranoid delusions, incoherent thinking, and significant anxiety. An initial risperidone treatment was soon changed to zuclopenhixol. Subsequently, severe extrapyramidal symptoms appeared, after which the medication was switched back to resperidone. Following this treatment, the patient left the health care facility and stopped the medication of his own volition. Psychotic symptoms and massive extrapyramidal symptoms again occurred. These symptoms subsided only slowly during a subsequent treatment with olanzapine. The development of adverse neurological effects together with a worsening of productive psychotic symptomatology may be explained by withdrawal of antipsychotic medication. These symptoms are often attributed to new medications, which are prematurely discontinued after the appearance of an adverse effect, but which are potentially beneficial to a patient, provided that enough time for a spontaneous subsidence of withdrawal-emergent effects is given. Any change in antipsychotic treatment should be carefully considered and thoroughly planned. © Versita Sp. z o.o.

N2  - Hallucinogenic drugs, including mescaline, psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), act at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (5-HT2ARs). Metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) ligands show efficacy in modulating the responses induced by activation of 5-HT2ARs. The formation of a 5-HT2AR-mGluR2 complex suggests a functional interaction that affects the hallucinogen-regulated cellular signaling pathways. Here, we tested the cellular and behavioral effects of hallucinogenic 5-HT2AR agonists in mGluR2 knockout (mGluR2-KO) mice. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with the hallucinogens DOI (2mg/kg) and LSD (0.24mg/kg), or vehicle. Head-twitch behavioral response, expression of c-fos, which is induced by all 5-HT2AR agonists, and expression of egr-2, which is hallucinogen-specific, were determined in wild type and mGluR2-KO mice. [3H]Ketanserin binding displacement curves by DOI were performed in mouse frontal cortex membrane preparations. Head twitch behavior was abolished in mGluR2-KO mice. The high-affinity binding site of DOI was undetected in mGluR2-KO mice. The hallucinogen DOI induced c-fos in both wild type and mGluR2-KO mice. However, the induction of egr-2 by DOI was eliminated in mGlu2-KO mice. These findings suggest that the 5-HT2AR-mGluR2 complex is necessary for the neuropsychological responses induced by hallucinogens. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - 5-HT and depression: Is the glass half-full?
A1  - Sharp T.
A1  - Cowen P.J. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Mood disorders such as major depression are common illnesses with considerable morbidity and significant mortality. A long-standing theory is that a breakdown in brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) signalling is critically involved in the symptoms and drug treatment of clinical depression. However, the nature of this 5-HT defect has proved to be frustratingly elusive, and it remains unclear how the 5-HT signalling effects of antidepressant drugs might alter neuropsychological mechanisms to bring about relief of depressed mood. This article highlights recent discoveries that advance our understanding of how 5-HT-evoked changes at molecular, cellular and neuropsychological levels might interact to alleviate the symptoms of clinical depression. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Multiple receptors contribute to the behavioral effects of indoleamine hallucinogens
A1  - Halberstadt A.L.
A1  - Geyer M.A. 
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Serotonergic hallucinogens produce profound changes in perception, mood, and cognition. These drugs include phenylalkylamines such as mescaline and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM), and indoleamines such as (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin. Despite their differences in chemical structure, the two classes of hallucinogens produce remarkably similar subjective effects in humans, and induce cross-tolerance. The phenylalkylamine hallucinogens are selective 5-HT2 receptor agonists, whereas the indoleamines are relatively non-selective for serotonin (5-HT) receptors. There is extensive evidence, from both animal and human studies, that the characteristic effects of hallucinogens are mediated by interactions with the 5-HT2A receptor. Nevertheless, there is also evidence that interactions with other receptor sites contribute to the psychopharmacological and behavioral effects of the indoleamine hallucinogens. This article reviews the evidence demonstrating that the effects of indoleamine hallucinogens in a variety of animal behavioral paradigms are mediated by both 5-HT2 and non-5-HT2 receptors. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Harm potential of magic mushroom use: A review

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - In 2007, the Minister of Health of the Netherlands requested the CAM (Coordination point Assessment and Monitoring new drugs) to assess the overall risk of magic mushrooms. The present paper is an updated redraft of the review, written to support the assessment by CAM experts. It summarizes the literature on physical or psychological dependence, acute and chronic toxicity, risk for public health and criminal aspects related to the consumption of magic mushrooms. In the Netherlands, the prevalence of magic mushroom use was declining since 2000 (last year prevalence of 6.3% in 2000 to 2.9% in 2005), and further declined after possession and use became illegal in December 2008.The CAM concluded that the physical and psychological dependence potential of magic mushrooms was low, that acute toxicity was moderate, chronic toxicity low and public health and criminal aspects negligible. The combined use of mushrooms and alcohol and the quality of the setting in which magic mushrooms are used deserve, however, attention. In conclusion, the use of magic mushrooms is relatively safe as only few and relatively mild adverse effects have been reported. The low prevalent but unpredictable provocation of panic attacks and flash-backs remain, however, a point of concern. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - The 5-HT2A/1A agonist psilocybin disrupts modal object completion associated with visual hallucinations

N2  - Background Recent findings suggest that the serotonergic system and particularly the 5-HT2A/1A receptors are implicated in visual processing and possibly the pathophysiology of visual disturbances including hallucinations in schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Methods To investigate the role of 5-HT2A/1A receptors in visual processing the effect of the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A/1A agonist psilocybin (125 and 250 mug/kg vs. placebo) on the spatiotemporal dynamics of modal object completion was assessed in normal volunteers (n = 17) using visual evoked potential recordings in conjunction with topographic-mapping and source analysis. These effects were then considered in relation to the subjective intensity of psilocybin-induced visual hallucinations quantified by psychometric measurement. Results Psilocybin dose-dependently decreased the N170 and, in contrast, slightly enhanced the P1 component selectively over occipital electrode sites. The decrease of the N170 was most apparent during the processing of incomplete object figures. Moreover, during the time period of the N170, the overall reduction of the activation in the right extrastriate and posterior parietal areas correlated positively with the intensity of visual hallucinations. Conclusions These results suggest a central role of the 5-HT2A/1A-receptors in the modulation of visual processing. Specifically, a reduced N170 component was identified as potentially reflecting a key process of 5-HT2A/1A receptormediated visual hallucinations and aberrant modal object completion potential. © 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

The serotonin and glutamate systems are suspected in the etiology of schizophrenia, as well as in the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs. The effects of hallucinogens, such as psilocybin and mescaline, require the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, and induce schizophrenia-like psychosis in humans. In addition, metabotropic glutamate receptor mGlu2/3 agonists show promise as a new treatment for schizophrenia. Here, we investigated the level of expression and behavioral function of 5-HT2A and mGlu2 receptors in a mouse model of maternal influenza viral infection. We show that spontaneous locomotor activity is diminished by maternal infection with the mouse-adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus. The behavioral responses to hallucinogens and glutamate antipsychotics are both affected by maternal exposure to influenza virus, with increased head-twitch response to hallucinogens and diminished antipsychotic-like effect of the glutamate agonist. In frontal cortex of mice born to influenza virus-infected mothers, the 5-HT2A receptor is upregulated and the mGlu2 receptor is downregulated, an alteration that may be involved in the behavioral changes observed. Additionally, we find that the cortical 5-HT2A receptor-dependent signaling pathways are significantly altered in the offspring of infected mothers, showing higher c-fos, egr-1, and egr-2 expression in response to the hallucinogenic drug DOI. Identifying a biochemical alteration that parallels the behavioral changes observed in a mouse model of prenatal viral infection may facilitate targeting therapies for treatment and prevention of schizophrenia.

N2  - Context: Researchers conducted extensive investigations of hallucinogens in the 1950s and 1960s. By the early 1970s, however, political and cultural pressures forced the cessation of all projects. This investigation reexamines a potentially promising clinical application of hallucinogens in the treatment of anxiety reactive to advanced- stage cancer. Objective: To explore the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with advanced-stage cancer and reactive anxiety. Design: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety, with subjects acting as their own control, using a moderate dose (0.2 mg/kg) of psilocybin. Setting: A clinical research unit within a large public sector academic medical center. Participants: Twelve adults with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. Main Outcome Measures: In addition to monitoring safety and subjective experience before and during experimental treatment sessions, follow-up data including results from the Beck Depression Inventory, Profile of Mood States, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were collected unblinded for 6 months after treatment. Results: Safe physiological and psychological responses were documented during treatment sessions. There were no clinically significant adverse events with psilocybin. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory trait anxiety subscale demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety at 1 and 3 months after treatment. The Beck Depression Inventory revealed an improvement of mood that reached significance at 6 months; the Profile ofMoodStates identified mood improvement after treatment with psilocybin that approached but did not reach significance. Conclusions: This study established the feasibility and safety of administering moderate doses of psilocybin to patients with advanced-stage cancer and anxiety. Some of the data revealed a positive trend toward improved mood and anxiety. These results support the need for more research in this long-neglected field. © 2011 American Medical Association.

T1  - How human electrophysiology informs psychopharmacology: From bottom-up driven processing to top-down control
A1  - Kenemans J.L.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - This review surveys human event-related brain potential (ERP) and event-related magnetic field (ERF) approaches to psychopharmacology and psychopathology, and the way in which they complement behavioral studies and other neuroimaging modalities. The major paradigms involving ERP/ERF are P50 suppression, loudness-dependent auditory evoked potential (LDAEP), mismatch negativity (MMN), P300, mental chronometry, inhibitory control, and conflict processing (eg, error-related negativity (ERN)). Together these paradigms cover a range of more bottom-up driven to more top-down controlled processes. A number of relationships between the major neurotransmitter systems and electrocortical mechanisms are highlighted. These include the role of dopamine in conflict processing, and perceptual processing vs motor preparation; the role of serotonin in P50 suppression, LDAEP, and MMN; glutamate/NMDA and MMN; and the role of acetylcholine in P300 generation and memory-related processes. A preliminary taxonomy for these relationships is provided, which should be helpful in attuning possible new treatments or new applications of existing treatments to various disorders. © 2011 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

N2  - The prevalent view today is that schizophrenia is a syndrome rather than a specific disease. Liability to schizophrenia is highly heritable. It appears that multiple genetic and environmental factors operate together to push individuals over a threshold into expressing the characteristic clinical picture. One environmental factor which has been curiously neglected is the evidence that certain drugs can induce schizophrenia-like psychosis. In the last 60years, improved understanding of the relationship between drug abuse and psychosis has contributed substantially to our modern view of the disorder suggesting that liability to psychosis in general, and to schizophrenia in particular, is distributed trough the general population in a similar continuous way to liability to medical disorders such as hypertension and diabetes. In this review we examine the main hypotheses resulting from the link observed between the most common psychotomimetic drugs (lysergic acid diethylamide, amphetamines, cannabis, phencyclidine) and schizophrenia. © 2011 Paparelli, Di Forti, Morrison and Murray.

N2  - The prodrug approach has become an extensive tool to prevent a myriad of undesirable biopharmaceutical properties like minimal oral absorption, permeability, toxicity, and excessive first pass metabolism, physicochemical properties like poor solubility, chemical instability, bad odour or taste, or pharmacodynamic properties like irritation or pain and promises to be very effective for treatment of many diseases in future. Targeted drug delivery by the prodrugs is one of the biggest goals currently challenging the pharmaceutical and formulation scientists. The future potential of prodrugs is very immense, enabling multimechanistic drug targeting approaches, and they may prove to be the legendary "magic bullets" for delivery of therapeutics. This review provides insight into various prodrug strategies explored to date for drug delivery to various sites. Several examples of where the prodrug approach has been used to achieve targeted delivery will be discussed.

N2  - Large events have been defined in many ways, from the vague description of a focused gathering of people to the more specific description of an event with at least 1,000 spectators and participants who are gathered at a specific location for a defined period of time. Regardless of the definition applied, the actual medical requirements vary considerably from one event to the next. The ability to predict these medical needs allows for the provision of adequate medical support. Many factors contribute to medical need at a large event, including event type, weather (particularly heat index), the presence of alcohol and / or illicit drugs, the number of participants, event duration, crowd demographics, and venue characteristics. This review will focus on the various features of large events such that the medical planner can better understand the challenge and provide adequate resource for patient care. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Rationale: This dose-effect study extends previous observations showing that psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences having persisting positive effects on attitudes, mood, and behavior. Objectives: This double-blind study evaluated psilocybin (0, 5, 10, 20, 30 mg/70 kg, p.o.) administered under supportive conditions. Methods: Participants were 18 adults (17 hallucinogen-naive). Five 8-h sessions were conducted individually for each participant at 1-month intervals. Participants were randomized to receive the four active doses in either ascending or descending order (nine participants each). Placebo was scheduled quasi-randomly. During sessions, volunteers used eyeshades and were instructed to direct their attention inward. Volunteers completed questionnaires assessing effects immediately after and 1 month after each session, and at 14 months follow-up. Results: Psilocybin produced acute perceptual and subjective effects including, at 20 and/or 30 mg/70 kg, extreme anxiety/fear (39% of volunteers) and/or mystical-type experience (72% of volunteers). One month after sessions at the two highest doses, volunteers rated the psilocybin experience as having substantial personal and spiritual significance, and attributed to the experience sustained positive changes in attitudes, mood, and behavior, with the ascending dose sequence showing greater positive effects. At 14 months, ratings were undiminished and were consistent with changes rated by community observers. Both the acute and persisting effects of psilocybin were generally a monotonically increasing function of dose, with the lowest dose showing significant effects. Conclusions: Under supportive conditions, 20 and 30 mg/70 kg psilocybin occasioned mystical-type experiences having persisting positive effects on attitudes, mood, and behavior. Implications for therapeutic trials are discussed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - This article elucidates a stepwise approach to the patient with an acute alteration in the content or level of consciousness. The article begins with a discussion of the spectrum of diminished responsiveness. It then details which aspects of the history are important in obtaining an evaluation of these patients and reviews the neurologic examination of the comatose patient. A brief overview of the neuroanatomical localization of consciousness is provided. The differential diagnosis of diminished responsiveness is explored, followed by a discussion of the order and importance of laboratory, neuroimaging, and other ancillary tests. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Alternative headache treatments: Nutraceuticals, behavioral and physical treatments
A1  - Sun-Edelstein C.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - There is a growing body of evidence supporting the efficacy of various complementary and alternative medicine approaches in the management of headache disorders. These treatment modalities include nutraceutical, physical and behavioral therapies. Nutraceutical options comprise vitamins and supplements (magnesium, riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, and alpha lipoic acid) and herbal preparations (feverfew, and butterbur). Although controversial, there are some reports demonstrating the benefit of recreational drugs such as marijuana, lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin in headache treatment. Behavioral treatments generally refer to cognitive behavioral therapy and biobehavioral training (biofeedback, relaxation training). Physical treatments in headache management are not as well defined but usually include acupuncture, oxygen therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, occlusal adjustment, cervical manipulation, physical therapy, massage, chiropractic therapy, and osteopathic manipulation. In this review, the available evidence for all these treatments will be discussed. © 2011 American Headache Society.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Pharmacologic and toxic effects of xenobiotics, such as drugs of abuse, depend on the genotype and phenotype of an individual, and conversely on the isoenzymes involved in their metabolism and transport. The current knowledge of such isoenzymes of frequently abused therapeutics such as opioids (oxycodone, hydrocodone, methadone, fentanyl, buprenorphine, tramadol, heroin, morphine and codeine), anesthetics (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, propofol, ketamine and phencyclidine) and cognitive enhancers (methylphenidate and modafinil), and some important plant-derived hallucinogens (lysergide, salvinorin A, psilocybin and psilocin), as well as of nicotine in humans are summarized in this article. The isoenzymes (e.g., cytochrome P450, glucuronyltransferases, esterases and reductases) involved in the metabolism of drugs and some pharmacokinetic data are discussed. The relevance of such data is discussed for predicting possible interactions with other xenobiotics, understanding pharmacokinetic behavior and pharmacogenomic variations, assessing toxic risks, developing suitable toxicological analysis procedures, and finally for interpretating drug testing results. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  - Despite longstanding reports of prolonged or reoccurring perceptual changes in a subset of hallucinogen users, very little is known about Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder and related visual abnormalities in hallucinogen users. We used an online questionnaire to document the symptoms and relationship to drug use of unusual visual phenomena in hallucinogen users. 16,192 individuals viewed the information sheet and 2679 were included in the study. Of these, 224 reported having unrelated diagnoses associated with unusual visual experiences and were excluded from main analyses. Most (60.6%) of the remaining 2455 participants reported having experienced drug-free visual experiences that resembled hallucinogen effects. Probability of experiencing constant or near-constant symptoms was predicted by greater past exposure to specific hallucinogens, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Although symptoms were common, few (104, or 4.2% of the sample) found them distressing or impairing enough to consider seeking treatment. Visual changes in hallucinogen users may be more common than previously suspected and are worthy of further study. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - We all have a sense of time. Yet, there are no sensory receptors specifically dedicated for perceiving time. It is an almost uniquely intangible sensation: we cannot see time in the way that we see color, shape, or even location. So how is time represented in the brain? We explore the neural substrates of metrical representations of time such as duration estimation (explicit timing) or temporal expectation (implicit timing). Basal ganglia (BG), supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex have all been linked to the explicit estimation of duration. However, each region may have a functionally discrete role and will be differentially implicated depending upon task context. Among these, the dorsal striatum of the BG and, more specifically, its ascending nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway seems to be the most crucial of these regions, as shown by converging functional neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and psychopharmacological investigations in humans, as well as lesion and pharmacological studies in animals. Moreover, neuronal firing rates in both striatal and interconnected frontal areas vary as a function of duration, suggesting a neurophysiological mechanism for the representation of time in the brain, with the excitatory-inhibitory balance of interactions among distinct subtypes of striatal neuron serving to fine-tune temporal accuracy and precision. © 2011 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: The perception of time is essential for survival and is required for the precise organization of sequences of activity as well as the anticipation of behavioral outcomes and future events. One form of temporal perception is interval timing, which refers to the discrimination of durations, typically in the seconds to minutes range. A variety of reports indicate that schizophrenia is associated with timing deficits, and it has been proposed that impaired temporal processing is a core deficit of schizophrenia that contributes to cognitive dysfunction, hallucinations, and inappropriate behavior. There is also evidence that the serotonergic system, which is believed to play a role in the neuropathology of schizophrenia, regulates temporal perception and timing behavior. For example, serotonergic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin markedly alter the subjective experience of time and disrupt interval timing. Unfortunately, very little is known about the neural substrate(s) that are involved in serotonergic modulation of timing. Characterizing the mechanism through which the serotonergic system regulates timing will increase our understanding of the linkage between serotonin (5-HT) and schizophrenia, and will provide insight into the mechanism of action of hallucinogenic drugs. Methods: We have developed a discrete trials interval timing task in mice that can be used to elucidate the neural and receptor mechanisms underlying the modulation of interval timing by both endogenous 5-HT and hallucinogenic drugs. This is a translational paradigm that is very similar to tasks used to assess timing in rats and humans. Development of the task in mice allows examination of the genetic contributions to performance, and facilitates the use of optogenetic challenges. In the discrete trials task, a lamp is illuminated for a variable duration, and then two levers are presented. Responding on lever A is reinforced if the stimulus duration is shorter than 6.5 s, and responding on lever B is reinforced if the stimulus duration is longer than 6.5 s. C57BL/6J mice were trained to discriminate between short (2.5 and 5.0 s) and long (7.5 and 10 s) stimulus durations, and then challenged with a wider range of test stimuli (1.25-11.75 s). To determine whether the performance of the task is sensitive to the effects of serotonergic ligands, we also examined whether the hallucinogen and 5-HT2A/ 2C receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) alters performance of the task. Results: We found that mice can learn to reliably discriminate between the short and long duration training stimuli, responding on the correct lever >80% of the time for the two extreme stimulus durations (2.5 and 10 s). Challenge studies demonstrated that the proportion of lever B responding increased with the stimulus duration. Administration of DOI (0.5-1.0 mg/kg, IP) markedly altered %B lever responding (F(14,28)=5.90, p<0.0001). The effect of DOI was not associated with a significant change in the response rate, suggesting that the effect reflects a disruption of interval timing, as opposed to nonspecific effects on operant responding. DOI also increased the Weber fraction, a measure of timing precision. Discussion: These experiments demonstrate that mice can be trained to perform an interval timing task, and indicate that timing in mice is altered by serotonergic hallucinogens. Development of timing tasks that are sensitive to hallucinogen effects is highly desirable because timing behavior is translatable, whereas many behavioral paradigms currently used to assess the effects of hallucinogens in rodents have no human counterpart, and thus it is not clear how the behaviors relate to the subjective effects of hallucinogens. Our goal is to use this behavioral paradigm to investigate the regulation of interval timing by the serotonergic system, and to determine the neural site(s) involved in this effect. It is possible that the disruption of temporal perception induced by hallucinogens could be developed as an animal model relevant to schizophrenia, potentially facilitating the development of novel agents with antipsychotic activity.

N2  - Purpose of the study: This study sought to identify the functional brain correlates of the psychedelic state using arterial spin labelling and the classic psychedelic drug psilocybin. Psilocybin has been used for centuries in spiritual contexts and it has a more recent history of use in psychotherapy. Psilocybin produces a highly unusual altered state of consciousness, characterised by abnormal perception and vivid imagination, and it is not uncommon for users to describe their experiences as meaningful and beneficial [1]. Understanding how the brain changes during such states may reveal mechanisms necessary for the maintenance of normal waking consciousness, and suggest how the psychedelic state may be beneficial e.g. in the context of psychotherapy. Methods: Fifteen healthy, hallucinogen-experienced subjects (5 females and 10 males), mean age 34.1 (SD 8.2) participated in this study. Subjects underwent an anatomical scan followed by two task-free functional scans, each lasting 18 minutes. Pulsed arterial spin labelling was used to measure dynamic changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) following the saline/drug infusions. All imaging was performed on a 3T GE HDx system. Whole brain perfusion was measured using single-shot pulsed arterial spin labelling and a QUIPSSII (Quantitative imaging of perfusion using a single subtraction) sequence with GE-EPI readout. 240 tag-control image pairs with 16 axial slices (3x3x6 mm voxel resolution, matrix = 64x64, with a 1 mm gap in the axial direction) were acquired. Solutions (10ml) were infused manually over 60 seconds beginning 6 minutes after the start of each functional scan. In every case, subjects received placebo (saline) in the first scan and psilocybin (2 mg) in the second. Within session changes in CBF following infusion were taken to the group level to reveal regions where CBF was significantly different after psilocybin versus after placebo. Results: Only decreased cerebral blood flow was observed after psilocybin (mixed effects analysis, cluster threshold = 2.3, p = 0.05) and this was significant in a number of subcortical and cortical regions. The decreases were remarkably well localized to key connector hubs in the brain, such as the thalamus, medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, and ratings of the intensity of the drug effects correlated positively with the magnitude of the CBF decreases. Conclusions: This was the first psychedelic drug fMRI study of its kind and the first modern neuroimaging study of psilocybin. The results make an important contribution to our understanding of the mechanism of action of psychedelics and may have implications for our understanding of consciousness. The observed decreases in CBF were in brain regions that are known to have higher than average resting state metabolism and connectivity. Decreased activity in these hub regions may compromise the brain's ability to integrate and constrain information processing, explaining the unconstrained quality of cognition in the psychedelic state. Moreover, the observed decreases were in regions that are typically hyperactive in depression, suggesting that psilocybin may be useful in this condition. This is consistent with recent reports of enduring positive mood following high-dose psilocybin [1].

N2  - Purpose: Pharmacological challenges with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists and 5-hydroxytryptamine2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonists have been used to produce psychosislike symptoms in healthy humans [1]. Although NMDA antagonists have been reported to more faithfully reproduce the full spectrum of psychopathology associated with schizophrenia than 5-HT2AR agonists, both classes of drugs engender a number of positive symptoms in common that are similar to those observed in schizophrenia. However, a neurocognitive base underpinning the formation of positive-like symptoms and particularly of thought disorder in these two models of psychosis is still missing. Recent theories of psychosis posit that aberrant encoding of prediction errors (PE) maybe lead to positive-like symptoms [2]. This study investigated whether the encoding of PE depicted via the mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential (ERP) depends on NMDA and/or 5-HT2AR neurotransmission, and whether the effects of ketamine and psilocybin administration on MMN can be used to predict thought disorders in healthy volunteers. Methods: Two groups (ketamine: N=19; psilocybin: N=20) of healthy subjects received in a double-blind, within-subjects design placebo versus ketamine or psilocybin. Ketamine infusion was initiated with a 10 mg bolus over 5 min, followed by a continuous infusion with 0.006 mg/kg*min. Psilocybin was given p.o. at a dose of 115 mg/kg. The MMN memory trace effect (MMN slope) was measured using a roving oddball design [3]. Note that the MMN slope response is due to learning and cannot be due to differential states of frequency-specific auditory neurons in the temporal cortex. ERP recordings were made from 64 scalp electrodes (10-20 system). A set of fronto-central (Fz, F3 and F4) and temporal electrodes (TP7 and TP8) were selected for statistical analysis. At the end of each ERP recording session, psychosis-like symptoms were assessed using a modified Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale, with focus on positive-like symptoms. Summary of results: As predicted, the MMN response under placebo increased systematically with number of standard repetitions at frontal electrodes [F(2,74) = 3.9, p < 0.05, eta2 = 0.1]. This memory trace effect (MMN slope) was significantly disrupted by ketamine as evidenced by a significant triple interaction between electrode, treatment and standard repetition [F(1,37) = 8.4, p < 0.005, eta2 = 0.19]. In contrast, psilocybin did not disrupt the MMN slope. Moreover, linear regression analysis revealed that the drug-free MMN slope, i.e., the mean increase across repetition conditions, significantly predicted ketamine-induced thought disorders (r = -0.67; p < 0.005). In the psilocybin group, no comparable correlations were found. Conclusion: The data suggest that the NMDAR but not the 5-HT2A/1AR system is implicated in the encoding of PE. The disruption of PE signalling may contribute to the formation of thought disorders. The assessment of the MMN slope may provide also a promising approach to characterize early phases of schizophrenia and may reflect a useful biomarker of drug response concerning the treatment of psychosis, especially of thought disorders.

N2  - Several experiments show that there is a cell to cell communicaton by light in different cell types. The most convincing experiment shows that baby hamster kidney cells can communicate their spatial orientation through a glass film, this can only happen by photon signals. If so, it can be assumed that the cells with the highest differentiation, the neurons also use this mechanism. The nervous system would have excellent conditions for a cell to cell communication by light. Neurons are large, metabolically very active (lightproducing) cells with wide arborisation, contain little pigment and are protected from ambient light by bone and connective tissue. Signal to noise ratio should be high for photon signals. It has been shown that light can be propagated along the axis tracts. Also the hollow microtubules (neurofibrillae) could act as light guiding structures. According to Jibu et al. their inner diameter of 15nm is ideal for light guidance free of thermal noise and loss. Other findings that may be of importance in this context, are the strong flurescence properties of the major hallucinogens: LSD, bufetonine, dimethyl-tryptamine, psilocybine, psilocin, iboguanin, harmine, cannabidinol and mescaline. Furthermore it has been shown that hallucinogenic properties of these substances have a direct correlation to their fluorescence properties and their readyness to donate electrons. As hypothesis we propose that the fluorescence interacts physically with the proposed Biophoton mediated cell to cell communication thus producing hallucinations. This would be an easy and plausible explanation for the strong hallucinogenic properties of these fluorescent substances.

N2  - Purpose: Schizophrenia patients exhibit deficits in cognition, resembling symptoms in healthy volunteers induced by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine and the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor agonist psilocybin [1]. A suitable tool to study learning is the event-related potential (ERP) mismatch negativity (MMN) within a roving oddball design. The measured impact of standard repetition on MMN (memory trace effect) in a roving paradigm promises to characterize the pathophysiological processes underlying cognitive impairment in schizophrenia more appropriately than classical oddball paradigms [2]. Hence, the purpose was to investigate, if the MMN memory trace generation and its underlying cognition depend on entire NMDAR or 5-HT neurotransmission. Specifically, the hypothesis was tested that the memory trace response maybe serves as predictor for cognitive impairments, interfered through alterations in NMDA and 5-HT mediated neurotransmission. Methods: Two groups (ketamine: N = 19; psilocybin: N=20) of healthy subjects received in a doubleblind, within-subjects design placebo versus ketamine or psilocybin. Ketamine infusion was initiated with a 10 mg bolus over 5 min, followed by a continuous infusion with 0.006 mg/kgxmin. Psilocybin was given p.o. at a dose of 115 mug/kg. The MMN memory trace effect was measured using a roving oddball design [3]. Structured sequences of sinusoidal tones were presented, with sporadically changing tone. The first tone of a train represents the deviant, which became the standard tone after a few repetitions. Note that standards and deviants are physically identical, therefore ensuing mismatch responses are due to learning and not to stimuli differences per se. ERP recordings were made from 64 scalp electrodes (10-20 system). At the end of each ERP session, subjective cognitive deficits were assessed (Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale). Summary of results: As predicted, in the placebo condition, the MMN response at frontal electrodes increased systematically with number of standard repetitions. This memory trace effect was significantly disrupted by ketamine as evidenced by a significant triple interaction between electrode, treatment and standard repetition [F(2,36)= 6.3; p < 0.01; eta2 = 0.26]. In contrast, psilocybin did not disrupt MMN (p > 0.33) and did not impair the memory trace effect. Multiple regression analysis showed that the MMN slope at baseline (MSB), i.e., the mean increase across repetition conditions, significantly predicted the cognitive impairment induced by ketamine (CI-k). In addition, also the Pearson correlation (MSB ~ CI-k) was significant (r =-0.79, p < 0.0001). In the psilocybin group, no comparable correlations were found. Conclusion: The NMDAR antagonist S-ketamine significantly diminished the MMN memory trace effect in healthy volunteers, similar to schizophrenic. The exhibited correlation between MMN slope at baseline and cognitive deficits induced by ketamine provides the assumptions that the MMN slope could be regarded as predictor for cognitive impairments in schizophrenia, mediated through a modified NMDAR neurotransmission. In other words, a smaller MMN slope indicates a less resilient NMDAR system, what raises the probability to impair cognition. Moreover, the MMN slope could further be viewed as useful biomarker of drug response concerning cognition in schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: The OAV questionnaire has been developed to integrate research on altered states of consciousness (ASC). It measures three primary and one secondary dimensions of ASC that are hypothesized to be invariant across ASC induction methods. The OAV rating scale has been in use for more than 20 years and applied internationally in a broad range of research fields, yet its factorial structure has never been tested by structural equation modeling techniques and its psychometric properties have never been examined in large samples of experimentally induced ASC. Methodology/Principal Findings: The present study conducted a psychometric evaluation of the OAV in a sample of psilocybin (n = 327), ketamine (n = 162), and MDMA (n = 102) induced ASC that was obtained by pooling data from 43 experimental studies. The factorial structure was examined by confirmatory factor analysis, exploratory structural equation modeling, hierarchical item clustering (ICLUST), and multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) modeling. The originally proposed model did not fit the data well even if zero-constraints on non-target factor loadings and residual correlations were relaxed. Furthermore, ICLUST suggested that the "oceanic boundlessness" and "visionary restructuralization" factors could be combined on a high level of the construct hierarchy. However, because these factors were multidimensional, we extracted and examined 11 new lower order factors. MIMIC modeling indicated that these factors were highly measurement invariant across drugs, settings, questionnaire versions, and sexes. The new factors were also demonstrated to have improved homogeneities, satisfactory reliabilities, discriminant and convergent validities, and to differentiate well among the three drug groups. Conclusions/Significance: The original scales of the OAV were shown to be multidimensional constructs. Eleven new lower order scales were constructed and demonstrated to have desirable psychometric properties. The new lower order scales are most likely better suited to assess drug induced ASC. © 2010 Studerus et al.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - The diagnosis and management of poisoned patients presenting with alterations in mental status can be challenging, as patients are often unable (or unwilling) to provide an adequate history. Several toxidromes exist. Recognition hinges upon vital signs and the physical examination. Understanding these " toxic syndromes" may guide early therapy and management, providing insight into the patient's underlying medical problem. Despite toxidrome recognition guiding antidotal therapy, the fundamental aspect of managing these patients involves meticulous supportive care. The authors begin with a discussion of various toxidromes and then delve into the drugs responsible for each syndrome. They conclude with a discussion on drug-facilitated sexual assault (" date rape" ), which is both an underrecognized problem in the emergency department (ED) and representative of the drug-related problems faced in a modern ED. © 2010.

N2  - Rationale: Trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine (TFMPP) is an active constituent of a relatively new group of recreational drugs known as 'party pills'. TFMPP has been anecdotally reported to induce mild psychedelic effects similar to lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin. There has been no research about the subjective effects of TFMPP in humans. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the subjective effects of TFMPP in human males. Methods: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial design was used to investigate the subjective effects of TFMPP in 30 healthy, non-smoking male volunteers (mean age 24+/-4 years). Participants were randomised into two groups and given either TFMPP 60 mg (n=15) or placebo (n=15). Each participant completed three rating scales, the Addiction Research Centre Inventory (ARCI), the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the Visual Analogue Scales (VAS), both before and 120 min after drug administration. Results: Results from the ARCI indicated that TFMPP produced increases in 'dysphoria' and 'dexamphetamine-like effects'. TFMPP also increased ratings of 'tension/anxiety' and 'confusion/bewilderment' as rated on the POMS. Results from the VAS indicated increases in 'drug liking', 'high' and 'stimulated' ratings relevant to placebo. Conclusions: Increased ratings of 'dexamphetamine-like effects', 'tension/anxiety', 'stimulated' and 'high' following TFMPP administration resemble the subjective effects of common amphetamine-type stimulants. However, increases in 'dysphoria' and 'confusion/bewilderment' ratings following TFMPP are more commonly associated with drugs that have greater effects on serotonin release, binding and reuptake such as 1-[3-chlorophenyl]-piperazine, fenfluramine and lysergic acid diethylamide. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Introduction: Texas has approximately 200 species of wild mushrooms, including toxic and hallucinogenic varieties. Mushroom ingestions in Texas were studied for 2005-2006. Methods: Data was obtained via Texas Poison Control Centers and retrospectively reviewed. Case notes were reviewed individually regarding initial reporting, age, signs and symptoms, toxic effect, management, and patient outcomes. Results: A total of 742 exposures occurred during the study period. All exposures were acute and intentional. Of these exposures, 59 (7.9%) were admitted to the hospital, with 17 (28.8% of admissions) requiring admission to a critical care unit. Four cases required inpatient psychiatric admission. The average age of admitted exposures was 20.5 years, with a male-to-female predominance of 3.3:1. Eleven (22.9%) of the admitted exposures were identified, with Psilocybin being the most common agent (n = 10, 91%). Among the admissions, co-ingestions were identified with the mushroom ingestion in eleven patients (40.7%). The most common symptoms in admitted patients were vomiting (n = 34, 57.6%), nausea (n = 19, 32.2%), altered mental status (n = 17, 28.8%), abdominal pain (n = 13, 22%), and diarrhea (n = 10, 16.9%). Conclusions: All mushroom exposures examined were acute and intentional. Major toxic reactions were uncommon, and no deaths were reported. Serious poisoning from mushroom ingestion is rare in Texas; however, there is greater need for information dissemination on morbidity.

The present study examined the effects of P. argentipes on marble-burying behavior, which is considered an animal model of obsessive-compulsive disorder. P. argentipes significantly inhibited marble-burying behavior without affecting locomotor activity as compared with the same dose of authentic psilocybin. These findings suggest that P. argentipes would be efficient in clinical obsessive-compulsive disorder therapy.

N2  - Substance use is prevalent in patients with psychiatric disorders and may cause severe symptoms in addition to complicating the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders. The aims of the study were to find the prevalence in use of alcohol, drugs, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, opiates and stimulants, and to find the prevalence of substance use disorders at admission to an acute psychiatric department receiving all admissions from a catchment area. Patients were interviewed about use of medications and intoxicating substances during the last week before admission in 227 consecutive admissions. Urine samples were analysed with the liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method. Use of substances was determined from reported use and findings in urine samples. Diagnoses were set at discharge according to ICD-10 research criteria. In 81.9% of the admissions, the patient had used alcohol, drugs, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, opiates or stimulants prior to admission. More men used alcohol, cannabis and stimulants, whereas more women used benzodiazepines. In 31.7% of the admissions, 49.5% of men and 16.4% of women, the patients had a substance use disorder (ICD-10, F10-19). Patients with substance use disorders had a shorter stay in hospital than other patients, and patients with no psychiatric disorder other than substance use disorders had a median length of stay of 2 days. Most patients had used psychoactive substances before admission to the acute psychiatric department, and half of the men had a substance use disorder.

N2  - This review explores the concept of using privileged scaffolds to identify biologically active compounds through building chemical libraries. We hope to accomplish three main objectives: to provide one of the most comprehensive listings of privileged scaffolds; to reveal through four selected examples the present state of the art in privileged scaffold library synthesis (in hopes of inspiring new and even more creative approaches); and also to offer some thoughts on how new privileged scaffolds might be identified and exploited. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - We report the case of a young woman who presented with several months ongoing formal thought disorder and deterioration of social functioning. Our differential diagnosis included cognitive impairment after malaria, schizotypal disorder and prodromal schizophrenia. With a combination of clinical observation, neuropsychology and functional magnetic resonance tomography (fMRI) measurement, we were able to establish the diagnosis of prodromal schizophrenia. This diagnosis was confirmed by a short psychotic outburst two months later. The additional acquired fMRI-measurement was in line with fMRI results of a study with unmedicated schizophrenic patients. Our fMRI measurement showed hypofrontality during a bimodal attention task which was reversed by treatment with clozapine. This case report documents the transition of prodromal schizophrenia to full-blown schizophrenia with the help of neuropsychology, fMRI and psychopharmacological treatment.

T1  - The 10 most important things known about addiction
A1  - Sellman D. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - If you were asked: 'What are the most important things we know about addiction?' what would you say? This paper brings together a body of knowledge across multiple domains and arranged as a list of 10 things known about addiction, as a response to such a question. The 10 things are: (1) addiction is fundamentally about compulsive behaviour; (2) compulsive drug seeking is initiated outside of consciousness; (3) addiction is about 50% heritable and complexity abounds; (4) most people with addictions who present for help have other psychiatric problems as well; (5) addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder in the majority of people who present for help; (6) different psychotherapies appear to produce similar treatment outcomes; (7) 'come back when you're motivated' is no longer an acceptable therapeutic response; (8) the more individualized and broad-based the treatment a person with addiction receives, the better the outcome; (9) epiphanies are hard to manufacture; and (10) change takes time. The paper concludes with a call for unity between warring factions in the field to use the knowledge already known more effectively for the betterment of tangata whaiora (patients) suffering from addictive disorders. © 2009 Society for the Study of Addiction.

T1  - Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert (Ram Dass) and the changing definition of psilocybin
A1  - Wark C.
A1  - Galliher J.F. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: This research focuses on the events leading to the 1968 U.S. federal prohibition of psilocybin. It is a study of duelling moral entrepreneurs-Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert vs. the Harvard University Administration. The goal is to show how the primary active compound in an ostensibly harmless fungus (the psilocybin mushroom) became controversial in less than a decade. Methods: We used books, newspapers, magazine articles and previously unpublished materials (including documents from the Harvard Archives) to analyze Leary and Alpert's lives and careers through the early 1970s. Results: The prohibition of psilocybin in the U.S. was largely a product of Leary and Alpert's involvement in the " Harvard drug scandal" and their transformation from Harvard professors to countercultural icons. They tested the substance on a variety of human subjects and in doing so piqued the interest of Harvard undergraduates while drawing condemnation from other faculty and Harvard administrators. This case is theoretically interesting because unlike most illegal drugs, psilocybin was never linked to a threatening minority group, but to some of the nation's most privileged youth. Conclusion: The Harvard administrators were not really moral entrepreneurs but Leary and Alpert clearly were. Although they were far from being prohibitionists, they were self-righteous crusaders on different but equally holy missions for the good of young and minority Americans. Ironically, due to their successes the possession of psilocybin was criminalized under United States federal law in 1968 (Pub. L. No. 90-639, Stat. 1361 1968 and Boire, 2002). This case study demonstrates that crusaders can be successful in changing culture even when laws are passed in futile attempts to control their behaviour, just as Leary predicted. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - The discriminative effects of the kappa-opioid hallucinogen salvinorin a in nonhuman primates: Dissociation from classic hallucinogen effects
A1  - Butelman E.R.

A1  - Prisinzano T.E.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Rationale: The widely available hallucinogen salvinorin A is a unique example of a plant-derived compound selective for kappa-opioid receptors and may produce effects distinct from those of other compounds with classic hallucinogenic or dissociative properties which are also abused in humans. Objectives: The objective of this study is to characterize the salvinorin A discriminative cue in nonhuman primates with high kappa-receptor genetic homology to humans. Methods: Adult rhesus monkeys (n-3) were trained to discriminate salvinorin A (0.015 mg/kg, s.c.) from vehicle, in a food-reinforced operant discrimination assay. Parallel studies, using unconditioned behavioral endpoints (facial relaxation and ptosis) also evaluated the kappa-opioid receptor mediation of salvinorin A in vivo function. Results: Monkeys trained to discriminate salvinorin A generalized structurally diverse, centrally penetrating kappa-agonists (bremazocine, U69,593, and U50,488). By contrast, mu-and delta-opioid agonists (fentanyl and SNC80, respectively) were not generalized, nor were the serotonergic 5HT2 hallucinogen psilocybin or the dissociative N-methyl-D-aspartic acid antagonist, ketamine. The discriminative effects of salvinorin A were blocked by the opioid antagonist quadazocine (0.32 mg/kg), but not by the 5HT2 antagonist ketanserin (0.1 mg/kg). Consistent with these findings, salvinorin and kappa-agonists (e.g., U69,593) produce effects in the unconditioned endpoints (e.g., ptosis), whereas psilocybin was inactive. Conclusions: These findings support the conclusion that the interoceptive/ discriminative cue produced by salvinorin A is mediated by agonism at kappa-receptors and is mechanistically distinct from that produced by a classic serotonergic hallucinogen. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

N2  - A confirmatory method for the determination of illicit drugs based on micro-solid phase extraction with modified tips, made of a functionalized fiberglass with apolar chains of octadecylsilane into monolithic structure, has been developed in this study. Drugs belonging to different chemical classes, such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, methylenedioxyethylamphetamine, methylenedioxymethylamphetamine, cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ketamine, mescaline, phencyclidine and psilocybine were analyzed. The quantitation was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and the analytes were detected in positive ionization by means of an electrospray source. The limits of quantification ranged between 0.3ngmL-1 for cocaine and 4.9ngmL-1 for psilocybine, with coefficients of determination (r2) >0.99 for all the analytes as recommended in the guidelines of Society of Forensic Toxicologists-American Association Forensic Sciences. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Background: Music festivals are known to attract a high proportion of drug users. Methods: Using a survey of 1,772 visitors at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark, we assessed substance use at the festival, the incidence of use of substances among never-users and the incidence of use among lifetime users who had not used a substance in the past 12 months. Results: New onset of tobacco use was reported by 9.2% of never-smokers, and new onset of cannabis use was reported by 9.3% of never-smokers of cannabis. Resumption of tobacco use was reported by 24% of past year abstainers, and resumption of cannabis use was reported by 30% of past year abstainers. New onset of other types of substances was reported by less than 0.5% of subjects, but among past year abstainers, 5-10% reported resumption of amphetamine, ketamine, MDMA and cocaine use. New onset smokers of cannabis were significantly younger than never-smokers. Conclusion: Music festivals such as the Roskilde Festival may be important arenas for the prevention of onset of tobacco and cannabis use and for a return to substance use. Copyright © 2010 S.

N2  - The tryptamine nucleus is a building block for many biologically-active derivatives (e.g., neurotransmitter serotonin or antimigraine drugs of the triptan series). A variety of N,. N-dialkylation of the nitrogen side chain can result in derivatives with psychoactive and hallucinogenic properties that are accessible by a large number of synthetic procedures.The renewed interest in human clinical studies coincides with increased public interest and exchange of information on the Internet, including discussion in scientific, popular and clandestine literature. Over the past few years, an increasing number of case reports have attracted the attention of clinical, pharmaceutical, forensic and public-health communities, underlining the current lack of pharmaco-toxicological and analytical data.This review assesses the current state of knowledge about the analytical profiling of drugs and by-products obtained from synthetic procedures discussed on Internet websites and scientific literature. Due to space considerations, we focus on detection using mass spectrometry (MS). We discuss commonalities and differences when considering fragmentation under a variety of ionization conditions and mass analysis using single-stage and multi-stage modes of MS.Key features of mass-spectral fragmentation include formation of iminium-ion CnH2n+2N+, normally assumed to be represented by appropriately substituted CH2N+(R1R2) species. Isomeric derivatives can often be differentiated by secondary and tertiary fragmentations that form CnH2n+2N+ species after loss of neutrals. Soft-ionization techniques (e.g., electrospray) are often characterized by intense [3-vinylindole]+-type species that reflect the extent of substitution on the indole ring. The fact that some tryptamines were found sensitive to halogenated solvents reminds the analyst to be aware of the potential for misinterpreting data when investigating the presence of route-specific impurities. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Hallucinogenic mushrooms (e.g. Psilocybe and Panaeolus species) as well as leaves and young shoots of the khat tree (Catha edulis Forsk) are illicit drugs in many countries. The exact concentration of the hallucinogenic alkaloids psilocin and psilocybin in mushrooms and the sympathomimetic alkaloids cathinone and cathine in khat is usually essential for jurisdiction. Facing an increasing number of mushroom and khat seizures by German customs authorities, a convenient comprehensive quantitative HPLC method based on cation-exchange liquid chromatography for these rather "exotic" drugs has been developed which avoids time-consuming multi-step sample preparation or chemical derivatization procedures. Using this method a number of different hallucinogenic fungi species and products that are mainly distributed via the internet have been analysed (dried and fresh Psilocybe cubensis Singer as well as P. cubensis collected from "grow boxes", Panaeolus cyanescens Berkeley and Broome and so-called "philosopher stones" (sclerotia of Psilocybe species)). Highest total amounts of psilocin have been detected in dried P. cyanescens reaching up to 3.00 +/- 0.24 mg per 100 mg. The distribution of khat alkaloids in different parts of the khat shoots has been studied. High concentrations of cathinone have not only been detected in leaves but also in green parts and barks of stalks. Additionally, the sample treatment for fresh mushroom and khat samples has been optimised. Highest amounts of alkaloids were found when fresh material was freeze-dried. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - Metabolism and toxicological analyses of hallucinogenic tryptamine analogues being abused in Japan

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Hallucinogenic tryptamine analogues, an important class of drugs of abuse, can be naturally occurring or chemically synthesized compounds. In Japan, psilocin and psilocybin (ingredients of "magic mushrooms") and 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-DIPT; a synthetic tryptamine) seem to be particularly problematic due to their extensive abuse. This review is focused on human metabolism and forensic toxicological analyses of the above three tryptamine analogues. In humans, psilocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated to form psilocin, and most of the psilocin is eventually conjugated to form its glucuronide. On the other hand, 5-MeO-DIPT is mainly metabolized via O-demethylation, 6-hydroxylation, and N-deisopropylation, partly followed by conjugation to form their sulfates and glucuronides. Suitable hydrolysis should be, therefore, applied for sensitive and effective analysis of the metabolites. In analyzing psilocin and psilocybin by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), derivatization is necessary for their discriminative identification. Although 5-MeO-DIPT and its three major metabolites can be analyzed by GC-MS without any derivatization, trimethylsilyl derivatization provides improvement of their peak shapes and intensities. In contrast to GC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry allow us not only to discriminate psilocin and psilocybin without derivatization, but also to directly analyze their conjugated metabolites. © 2010 Japanese Association of Forensic Toxicology.

N2  - Rationale The widely available hallucinogen salvinorin A is a unique example of a plant-derived compound selective for kappa-opioid receptors and may produce effects distinct from those of other compounds with classic hallucinogenic or dissociative properties which are also abused in humans. Objectives The objective of this study is to characterize the salvinorin A discriminative cue in nonhuman primates with high kappa-receptor genetic homology to humans. Methods Adult rhesus monkeys (n=3) were trained to discriminate salvinorin A (0.015 mg/kg, s.c.) from vehicle, in a food-reinforced operant discrimination assay. Parallel studies, using unconditioned behavioral endpoints (facial relaxation and ptosis) also evaluated the kappa-opioid receptor mediation of salvinorin A in vivo function. Results Monkeys trained to discriminate salvinorin A generalized structurally diverse, centrally penetrating kappaagonists (bremazocine, U69,593, and U50,488). By contrast,- and delta-opioid agonists (fentanyl and SNC80, respectively) were not generalized, nor were the serotonergic 5HT2 hallucinogen psilocybin or the dissociative N-methylD-aspartic acid antagonist, ketamine. The discriminative effects of salvinorin A were blocked by the opioid antagonist quadazocine (0.32 mg/kg), but not by the 5HT2 antagonist ketanserin (0.1 mg/kg). Consistent with these findings, salvinorin and kappa-agonists (e.g., U69,593) produce effects in the unconditioned endpoints (e.g., ptosis), whereas psilocybin was inactive. Conclusions These findings support the conclusion that the interoceptive/ discriminative cue produced by salvinorin A is mediated by agonism at kappa-receptors and is mechanistically distinct from that produced by a classic serotonergic hallucinogen. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

N2  - Hallucinations are a common symptom in pediatric populations. Because spontaneous rapid recovery often occurs, routine medication with antipsychotic drugs should be avoided.An adequate initial etiological assessment requires a medical examination, a psychiatric interview, and a meeting with key adult informants. Laboratory testing and imaging may also be useful.The risk of self-injury or harming others must be systematically assessed and should determine the choice between prescribing a nonspecific anxiolytic medication or hospitalizing the child.Treatment should combine psychotherapy and psychoeducation, and antipsychotics should be given in case of prodromal psychotic presentation.In the years to come, randomized controlled trials should define the exact role that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation might play as a treatment of hallucinations in children and adolescents. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Psilocybe cubensis (Ear.) Sing., Strophariaceae, is a hallucinogen mushroom that has been used since the old times by humans, causing several psychotic effects. P. cubensis contains two tryptamine derivates: psilocybin and psilocin, agonists of the 5-HT2 receptor (serotonin). The main objective of this study was to investigate the acute toxicity effects of P. cubensis aqueous extract(PCAE) administration in mice. Male and female adult Swiss mice received PCAE 0.1 mL/10 g i.p., and were observed individually, directly in a glass box and in an open-field. In relation to the data of the control group, PCAE-treated animals presented: an increased gnawing, appearance of wet-dog shakes and a decreased locomotion and rearing frequencies after 29-38 min. Also a clear gender difference was detected, being female mice more sensible to the PCAE than males. It was suggested that PCAE administration produced specific effects on mice behaviors, characteristic of drugs which interfere on central serotonergic and dopaminergic systems. Finally, the observational methods here employed were efficient to evaluate the toxic effects of the extract.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - There is much evidence for participation of electron transfer (ET) functionalities in the physiological action of drugs and toxins. The main ET agents are quinones, metal complexes, aromatic nitro compounds and iminium and imine species. Some are usually formed as metabolites. The last category, the least well known, is the focus of the review. First, examples of imines and iminiums in various bioactive classes are provided along with data on physiological activity, mechanism, ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and electron affinic properties. Emphasis is on events at the fundamental molecular level. This review documents various iminoquinones, imine and iminium agents in the marine alkaloid category. Bioactivity is addressed in addition to other mechanisms. The conjugated members of those classes have the potential of participating in ET reactions which can generate reactive oxygen species or become involved in the central nervous system. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

T1  - The neurobiology of psychedelic drugs: Implications for the treatment of mood disorders
A1  - Vollenweider F.X.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - After a pause of nearly 40 years in research into the effects of psychedelic drugs, recent advances in our understanding of the neurobiology of psychedelics, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and ketamine have led to renewed interest in the clinical potential of psychedelics in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders. Recent behavioural and neuroimaging data show that psychedelics modulate neural circuits that have been implicated in mood and affective disorders, and can reduce the clinical symptoms of these disorders. These findings raise the possibility that research into psychedelics might identify novel therapeutic mechanisms and approaches that are based on glutamate-driven neuroplasticity. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

T1  - User perceptions of the benefits and harms of hallucinogenic drug use: A web-based questionnaire study
A1  - Carhart-Harris R.L.
A1  - Nutt D.J. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - This study used a web-based questionnaire to investigate user perceptions of the benefits and harms of hallucinogenic drug use. Over 600 forms were submitted. Users were asked to comment on the acute and prolonged effects of different drugs and to provide more specific information on how particular drugs have harmed andor helped them. Subjects reported relatively less harm associated with the classic hallucinogens, LSD and psilocybin, than other drugs specifically focused on in the questionnaire (MDMA, cannabis, ketamine and alcohol). A wide-range of benefits was reported, including: help with mood disorders, addictions and migraine as well as more general long-term improvements in wellbeing. Symptoms of hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder were reported by a number of subjects and these were most closely associated with use of LSD; however, few users regarded these effects as troubling. Eighty-one per cent of users reported having had a 'spiritual experience' on a hallucinogenic drug and over 90% considered 'access to the unconscious mind' to be a specific property of the classic hallucinogens. With caution, these findings support recent calls for a systematic investigation of the therapeutic potential of the classic hallucinogens and highlight the scope for empirical investigations of spiritual and psychodynamic phenomena. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd.

T1  - Analytical methods for psychoactive N,N-dialkylated tryptamines
A1  - Brandt S.D.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Many N,. N-dialkylated tryptamine derivatives can induce altered states of consciousness in humans. The term " hallucinogen" is often used when describing the effect on the human mind, and the extent of psychoactivity depends on the nature of substituents attached to the ethylamine side chain and the indole ring. Naturally-occurring tryptamines (e.g., N,. N-dimethyltryptamine and psilocybin) have increasingly been investigated in human clinical studies, which increased interest within a number of scientific communities and the public. Many of these derivatives are controlled substances and an increasing number of previously unreported and structurally modified N,. N-dialkylated " designer" tryptamines with unknown bioactive profiles have become available.This review provides an overview of analytical methodologies published in recent years on detection and characterization of 40 N,. N-dialkylated derivatives. The majority of literature available utilized reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography and/or capillary electrophoresis. Derivatization was not normally required for sufficient separation and detection.Bioanalytical applications and characterization of natural products have not been included due to space limitations. The majority of analytical data described in the literature indicated the dominance of N,. N-dialkylated derivatives carrying a methoxy group or hydrogen at the 5-position of the indole ring. A consistent body of data has been produced and should set the scene for the detection of derivatives in order to inform healthcare providers, clinicians, forensic scientists and potential consumers. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - This review focuses on the chemistry and biomolecular mechanisms of action of several tryptamine derivatives. The substances chosen are of great biological importance. Serotonin and melatonin are both neurohormones, strongly interconnected metabolically. They regulate sleep, apetite, anger and dreaming. Another group of tryptamine derivatives, emphasized here, is the one of dimethyltryptamines. Psilocin, psilocybin, bufotenin are hallucinogens. Triptans are synthetic antimigraine drugs, now widely used.

N2  - Objective: Hallucinogenic mushrooms are increasingly available. After some serious incidents with tourists who had used magic mushrooms, the Dutch government asked the "Coordination Centre for Assessment and Monitoring of new Drugs" (CAM) for a risk assessment. Methods: The CAM, with experts from scientific institutes involved in monitoring, research, and criminal investigation related to drugs of abuse, performed a risk assessment on hallucinogenic mushrooms according to established procedures: review of available literature, scoring of the risks for individual health, public health, public safety, and organized crime. Results: Scientifically, the risk assessment is straightforward: acute toxicity is mainly confined to anxiety or panic attacks and chronic toxicity to the occurrence of flashbacks. The number of incidents reported is low. The risks for disturbing public order and criminal involvement are small. The Amsterdam municipal health department described that in 1 out of 2500 cases of mushroom use, an ambulance was called. Ninety-two per cent of these calls concerned tourists. Only 2 out of 100,000 uses actually led to hospital admission. Tourists are considered a vulnerable group, using magic mushrooms in an unfamiliar setting, sometimes impatiently taking an overdose while waiting for the hallucinogenic effects to occur. The CAM advised the provision of high quality user information especially aimed at tourists. The CAM explicitly warned that prohibiting hallucinogenic mushrooms could create new, more dangerous situations: the use of stronger hallucinating drugs, and possible criminal involvement like hiding psilocybin in chocolates. Nevertheless, the Minister of Health prohibited the selling and use of hallucinogenic mushrooms in 2008. The arguments of the CAM were considered valid, but too difficult to carry out. Conclusion: Up till now the NPIC received fewer questions on magic mushroom use, but more on other drugs of abuse like GHB and cocaine. After the prohibition of magic mushrooms in the UK in 2005 its use declined in the first year and remained stable later on. The use of cocaine increased.

N2  - Purpose: The primary objective of this double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study is to assess the efficacy of psilocybin administration (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), a serotonergic psychoactive agent, on psychosocial distress, with the specific primary outcome variable being anxiety associated with advanced, recurrent or potentially life threatening cancer. Researchers at New York University School of Medicine and Bluestone Center for Clinical Research are conducting this Phase II pilot study investigating the effects of psilocybin on anxiety and psychosocial distress in advanced cancer patients. Psilocybin is a psychoactive agent found in a specific type of mushroom and used for centuries for religious and spiritual purposes. This study is separate but similar to a recently completed study at the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, and to an ongoing study at the Johns Hopkins University. A secondary objective of the study is to determine the feasibility of administering psilocybin to this patient population, with regards to the following issues: safety, patient recruitment, consent for treatment, and retention. Methods: The study utilizes a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover design at 7 weeks and includes prospective follow-up of 6 months duration. The dose of psilocybin is 0.3mg/kg and the total subjects for the study is 32. Nine sessions of psychotherapy are conducted with two dedicated therapists, constituting a therapeutic dyad. Secondary outcome measures will look at the effect of psilocybin on symptoms of pain perception, depression, existential/ psychospiritual distress, attitudes towards disease progression and death, quality of life, and spiritual/mystical states of consciousness. Stephen Ross, M.D., Director of the Division of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse at Bellevue Hospital, is the Principal Investigator of this project. Subject enrollment began in April, 2009. Results: As this Phase II study is currently underway, we have collected preliminary data; relevant outcomes from our sister studies at UCLA and Johns Hopkins will be addressed. We will present an overview of the study design and hope to foster collaboration between professionals dedicated to studying and facilitating cancer treatment and researchers using this novel compound and therapy modality. Conclusion: It is hypothesized that a one time experience with psilocybin will occasion dramatic shifts in consciousness and meaningful spiritual experiences that will lead to short-term and long-term improvement in anxiety, depression, and pain associated with advanced cancer.

N2  - Salvinorin A, a neoclerodan diterpene, is a naturally occurring, potent, nonnitrogenous kappa opioid agonist, with no other known activity across 50 other receptors, transporters, and ion channels, including the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor, which is the principal site of activity of classic hallucinogens such as LSD and psilocybin [1]. It is the primary psychoactive constituent of the Salvia divinorum plant, which has been used in traditional spiritual practices by the Mazatec Indians of Mexico. Although traditional use dates back centuries, use among US and European users dates back only about a decade. Although in traditional Mexican use the leaves of Salvia divinorum were chewed or made into an infusion and swallowed, smoking is the most frequent administration route for contemporary use. Because it is legal in most countries, Salvia divinorum leaves and extracts are sold on the internet and in "head shops." At least 1.8 million people age 12 or older have used the drug in the US [2]. Not surprisingly, salvinorin A is coming increasingly under regulatory scrutiny with abuse among adolescents being a particular concern. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the subject-rated and physiological effects of salvinorin A in humans using rigorous clinical pharmacology procedures. In addition to providing information about this novel drug, understanding the pharmacology of this selective kappa agonist has the potential to help identify novel opioid receptor modulators with therapeutic applications in the treatment of certain psychiatric disorders and pain. This is a double-blind, placebo controlled, ascending dose run-up study in which volunteers with histories of hallucinogen use, including Salvia divinorum, participate in up to 16 sessions in which increasing doses of salvinorin A are administered, and 4 pseudo-randomly intermixed sessions in which placebo is administered. Salvinorin A doses range from 0.000375 to 0.0215 mg/kg, and participants only receive subsequent doses if lower doses are tolerated. To model smoking, this study involves the inhalation of heat-vaporized salvinorin A. Outcome measures include the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS) [3], as well as repeated assessments at 2-minute intervals for 30 minutes for subject-rated drug strength, various observer-rated effects, and blood pressure and pulse throughout the session. Two volunteers have completed sessions involving dose of up to 0.0165 mg/kg. Preliminary analyses show that active salvinorin A sessions have resulted in significantly higher increases than placebo sessions for the HRS, subject-rated drug strength, pulse, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Effects were generally an increasing function of dose. Results show orderly time-related effects, with maximal drug effect observed immediately after drug administration. Drug effects were substantially resolved by 20 minutes. Psychoactive effects were detected at 0.0015 mg/kg and higher, but not at lower doses. In conclusion, Salvinorin A has dose-related hallucinogenlike activity and relatively brief effects, consistent with anecdotal reports.

N2  - Background: In the visual backward masking paradigm, the visibility of a visual target is disrupted by the presence of a mask that is presented after the target. Studies using backward masking suggest that conscious and nonconscious responses to complex emotional stimuli (facial expressions) occur via parallel cortical and subcortical circuits [1]. Subliminally (nonconscious) presented fearful faces were found to enhance early event-related potentials (ERPs) like the N170 component, whereas supraliminal (conscious) perception of fearful stimuli was associated with enhanced responses for later components (i.e., N400). Although many studies investigated neuronal correlates of facial perception, little is known about specific neurotransmissions during these processes. Emotional (facial) processing is disrupted in schizophrenia patients, and there is evidence that serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission is involved in the modulation of emotional face processing [2]. To investigate the influence of 5-HT on processing of emotional stimuli the present study assessed ERPs evoked by emotional facial expressions (happy/fearful) in healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of the psychotomimetic and 5-HT1A/2A agonist psilocybin. Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subjects design, 13 healthy volunteers received either psilocybin (115 mug/kg p.o) or placebo in a balanced and random sequence. On drug peak effect (80 min) subjects underwent backward masking test using visual stimuli of emotional (happy/fearful) and neutral facial expression (taken from the Ekman-Friesen series [3]). Targets were happy/fearful and neutral faces presented subliminal (10 ms) or supraliminal (200 ms), and were backward-masked by a neutral face. EEG was acquired at 512 Hz using the ActiveTwo system (Biosemi, The Netherlands) with 64 equally-spaced scalp electrodes (10-20 system). The mean values for the N170 component from the electrodes PO7/8 were subjected to a 3 (emotion) x 2 (treatment) repeated measures ANOVA separately for sub- and supraliminal presentation times. Upon significant interactions or main effect of the factor "emotion" post-hoc pair-wise comparisons were conducted using Fisher's Least Significant Difference (Fisher LSD). The significance level was set to p<0.05. Results: Subliminal processing: Compared to placebo treatment with psilocybin reduced N170 amplitude (p<0.05). Furthermore, also the main effect of factor "emotion" (p<0.05), but not the interaction between the two factors reached statistical significance. Post-hoc testing revealed that the N170 amplitude for negative (p<0.001) and positive faces (p<0.05) but not for neutral faces was significantly reduced following psilocybin administration. Supraliminal processing: Whether the main effect of neither the factor "treatment" or "emotion", nor their interaction attained significance. Conclusion: The present results implicate that 5-HT neurotransmission is involved in subliminal processing of emotional stimuli. Late ERP components (i.e., N400) will be analysed in a subsequent analysis (in prep.) to study the impact of 5-HT on supraliminal processing. The findings add to our understanding of the neurobiology of impaired emotional processing which is relevant in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and affective disorders.

N2  - Objective. Time perception is a key function of human and its disturbance is associated with many psychiatric diseases. Current study aims to investigate the association of genetic polymorphisms related to the activity of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) systems (such as 5-HTTLPR, 5HT2a, MAOA, DAT, DRD2, COMT) with the individual differences in duration representation. Methods: The duration discrimination task (DT) in the order of several seconds was used. Forty-five right-handed Russian Caucasians males (18-35 years old) took part in the experiment. DT-based points of subjective equality (PSE) were calculated. Assuming the 'dual klepsydra model', these PSE values were transformed to equivalent values of parameter kappa, which is a measure of the 'loss rate' of internal (neural) representation of temporal durations. Results: Our data revealed the association between 5-HT-related genes and subjective time representation, but not with DA-related genes. Genotypes, characterized with the higher 5-HT transmission, such as 5-HTTLPR SS polymorphism compared with LL, 'low expression' variant (3) of MAOA VNTR gene compared with 'high expression' variant (4), TT polymorphism of 5-HT2a T102C gene compared with CC, have increased 'loss rate' of the cumulative duration representation. This is in line with an earlier study showing that parameter kappa; is significantly increased by psilocybin (agonist of 5-HT2a receptors) intake. Conclusions: These convergent findings suggest that increased level of 5-HT transmission, effectuated by internal (genetic) or external (neurochemical) factors, results in increased 'loss rate' and thus enhances 'subjective shortening' of elapsed time intervals. Therefore, the causal link from genes related to 5-HT activity to individual differences in duration representation is suggested.

N2  - Background: Psilocybin is the tryptamine constituent in the mushroom genus Psilocybe. Several species are found in the Pacific Northwest. Injury and death are rare from recreational use but typically stem from the consequences of abnormal behavior. Case: A healthy 20-year-old male reportedly ingested as much as 4 g of hallucinogenic mushrooms one evening (typical single ingestion is 1/8 g) prior to entering a sleeping woman's apartment. Upon awakening, she demanded he leave and a struggle ensued. Police were summoned to the home but the man became increasingly violent and failed to comply with their commands. He did not submit to multiple Taser discharges. Instead, he managed to pull out or break the wires and continued to struggle and attempted to grab the officer's pistol. After fleeing outdoors, additional attempts to subdue the man included nine beanbag rounds and additional Taser applications, all without effect. After attempting entry into a police vehicle containing a loaded rifle, the man was shot and killed. Autopsy report confirmed the lethal gunshot wound to the head. Toxicology screening revealed a urine psilocin concentration of 4,200 ng/mL, while an organic base screen (including PCP), mescaline, cocaine and methamphetamine screen were all negative. Discussion: Psilocybin acts a serotonin agonist, particularly at 5HT-2a receptors. The hallucinogenic effects manifest by perceptual distortion, a sense of unreality and depersonalization can lead to bizarre but seemingly purposeful behavior resulting in violence and apparent unresponsiveness to painful stimuli. Conclusion: We describe a case of acute psilocybin intoxication associated with violent behavior resulting in a tragic shooting death.

N2  - Consumption of natural hallucinogenic substances continues to be a problem. In this case we report from a young male patient presenting with an acute coronary syndrome with significant ST-elevation after the abuse of psychoactive fungi, commonly referred to as "magic mushrooms". Coronary angiography excludes relevant coronary artery disease. In ventriculography contractile dysfunction with hypokinesia in the apical segments could be documented reminiscent to wall motion abnormalities in Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC). Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging showed no pathological signal activity in the late-enhancement sequences ruling out myocardial infarction or inflammatory processes. Ventricular function normalized within several days. The active metabolite of psychoactive fungi psilocybin is known to interact with several different dopaminergic, adrenergic and serotonergic receptors. Thus, the pathomechanisms leading to contractile dysfunction after consumption of psychoactive fungi are reminiscent to those documented in TTC. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Most mushroom intoxications become evident within 12 hours with vomiting and diarrhea. They can be divided into incidents with a short latency (less than four hours) and incidents with a long latency (longer than four hours). As a rule of thumb amatoxin poisonings must be considered in case of symptoms appearing with a long latency (8-12-18 h), especially after consumption of non-controlled wild mushrooms. Shorter latencies do not exclude amatoxin poisoning. Large meals of mushrooms, which are rich in chitin, mixed meals and individual factors, may shorten latency and disguise amatoxin poisoning. Any vomiting and diarrhea after mushroom consumption is suspicious. Unless the mushrooms are not to be identified within 30 minutes by an expert, specific treatment for amatoxin poisoning must be started. Identification shall be achieved by macroscopic or microscopic means; and urine analysis for amatoxins are crucial. By commencing treatment before analysis, mortality rates may be as low as 5 %. Current standards in amatoxin poisoning treatment can be obtained at the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre (Phone 145), where contacts to mycologists are available as well. Emergency mycologists are listed on the website www.vapko.ch. Of the 18 different syndroms we present the most common and most important in Switzerland. In an overview all of them are listed. Early Gastrointestinal Syndrom with its short latency of less than 4h and indigestion with a very variable latency are the most common. Psychotropic symptoms after consumptions of fly agaric and panther cap are rare, in case of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, symptoms are frequent, but hardly ever lead to medical treatment. In case of renal failure and rhabdomyolysis of unknown origin, completing a patient's history by questioning nutritional habits might reveal causal relationship with ingestion of orellanin-containing mushrooms or tricholoma equestre respectively. Mushrooms in the backyard are attractive for children. We discuss possible approaches. © 2009 by Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG.

T1  - Novel, unifying mechanism for mescaline in the central nervous system: Electrochemistry, catechol redox metabolite, receptor, cell signaling and structure activity relationships
A1  - Kovacic P.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - A unifying mechanism for abused drugs has been proposed previously from the standpoint of electron transfer. Mescaline can be accommodated within the theoretical framework based on redox cycling by the catechol metabolite with its quinine counterpart. Electron transfer may play a role in electrical effects involving the nervous system in the brain. This approach is in accord with structure activity relationships involving mescaline, abused drugs, catecholamines and etoposide. Inefficient demethylation is in keeping with the various drug properties, such as requirement for high dosage and slow acting. There is a discussion of receptor binding, electrical effects, cell signaling and other modes of action. Mescaline is a nonselective, seretonin receptor agonist. 5-HTP receptors are involved in the stimulus properties. Research addresses the aspect of stereochemical requirements. Receptor binding may involve the proposed quinone metabolite and/or the amino sidechain via protonation. Electroencephalographic studies were performed on the effects of mescaline on men. Spikes are elicited by stimulation of a cortical area. The potentials likely originate in nonsynaptic dendritic membranes. Receptor-mediated signaling pathways were examined which affect mescaline behavior. The hallucinogen belongs to the class of 2AR agonists which regulate pathways in cortical neurons. The research identifies neural and signaling mechanisms responsible for the biological effects. Recently, another hallucinogen, psilocybin, has been included within the unifying mechanistic framework. This mushroom constituent is hydrolyzed to the phenol psilocin, also active, which is subsequently oxidized to an ET o-quinone or iminoquinone. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.

T1  - Psychedelics and schizophrenia

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Research on psychedelics such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and dissociative drugs such as phencyclidine (PCP) and the symptoms, neurochemical abnormalities and treatment of schizophrenia have converged. The effects of hallucinogenic drugs resemble some of the core symptoms of schizophrenia. Some atypical antipsychotic drugs were identified by their high affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, which is also the target of LSD-like drugs. Several effects of PCP-like drugs are strongly affected by both 5-HT2A and metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptor modulation. A serotonin-glutamate receptor complex in cortical pyramidal neurons has been identified that might be the target both of psychedelics and the atypical and glutamate classes of antipsychotic drugs. Recent results on the receptor, signalling and circuit mechanisms underlying the response to psychedelic and antipsychotic drugs might lead to unification of the serotonin and glutamate neurochemical hypotheses of schizophrenia. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Indole alkaloids of Psilocybe cubensis have been reported to be the potential candidates for drug discovery in central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In this research, the effect of the harvesting light on increasing the active alkaloids of P. cubensis was investigated. Three different lighting conditions, that is, dim daylight, indirect daylight, and darkness were used to harvest the mushrooms. A simple one-step extraction method involving the homogenization of the dried fruit bodies of fungi in chloroform was used. The psilocin content of the mushrooms was analyzed by derivatization with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA), followed by the GC-MS technique. This investigation showed that the psilocin content of the mushrooms was highly dependent on the lighting conditions. Variations could amount to 100-fold increases in the samples harvested in the dark condition, compared to the samples harvested in the light conditions. Therefore, preventing natural light in the harvesting chamber could be considered to have a considerable effect on the content of the psychotropic component of P. cubensis and, hence, the psycho activity of the mushroom. © 2009 by Begell House, Inc.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - This study assesses the availability of websites offering to sell psilocybin spores and psilocybin, a powerful hallucinogen contained in Psilocybe mushrooms. Over a 25-month period beginning in March 2003, eight searches were conducted in Google using the term "psilocybin spores." In each search the first 100 nonsponsored links obtained were scored by two independent raters according to standardized criteria to determine whether they offered to sell psilocybin or psilocybin spores. No attempts were made to procure the products offered for sale in order to ascertain whether the marketed psilocybin was in fact "genuine" or "counterfeit." Of the 800 links examined, 58% led to websites offering to sell psilocybin spores. Additionally, evidence that whole Psilocybe mushrooms are offered for sale online was obtained. Psilocybin and psilocybin spores were found to be widely available for sale over the Internet. Online purchase of psilocybin may facilitate illicit use of this potent psychoactive substance. Additional studies are needed to assess whether websites offering to sell psilocybin and psilocybin spores actually deliver their products as advertised.

T1  - Response of cluster headache to Kudzu
A1  - Sewell R.A. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Objective. - To describe the self-treatment of cluster headache with kudzu. Background. - Many cluster headache patients take over-the-counter (OTC) kudzu extract in the belief that it helps their cluster attacks. Kudzu's actual efficacy has not been studied. Methods. - A database of cluster headache patients was questioned about their use of various alternative remedies to treat their cluster headache. Of 235 patients identified, 16 had used kudzu, consented to interviews, and provided medical records. Results. - In total, 11 (69%) experienced decreased intensity of attacks, 9 (56%) decreased frequency, and 5 (31%) decreased duration, with minimal side effects. Conclusion. - Anecdotal evidence suggests that a component in OTC products labeled as kudzu may prove useful in managing cluster headache. This hypothesis should be tested with a randomized clinical trial. © 2008 the Author.

T1  - Disrupted 'reflection' impulsivity in cannabis users but not current or former ecstasy users

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Evidence for serotonin involvement in impulsivity has generated interest in the measurement of impulsivity in regular ecstasy users, who are thought to display serotonergic dysfunction. However, current findings are inconsistent. Here, we used a recently developed Information Sampling Test to measure 'reflection' impulsivity in 46 current ecstasy users, 14 subjects who used ecstasy in the past, 15 current cannabis users and 19 drug-naive controls. Despite elevated scores on the Impulsivity subscale of the Eysenck Impulsiveness-Venturesomeness-Empathy questionnaire, the current and previous ecstasy users did not differ significantly from the drug-naive controls on the Information Sampling Test. In contrast, the cannabis users sampled significantly less information on the task, and tolerated a lower level of certainty in their decision-making, in comparison to the drug-naive controls. The effect in cannabis users extends our earlier observations in amphetamine- and opiate-dependent individuals (Clark, et al., 2006, Biological Psychiatry 60: 515-522), and suggests that reduced reflection may be a common cognitive style across regular users of a variety of substances. However, the lack of effects in the two ecstasy groups suggests that the relationship between serotonin function, ecstasy use and impulsivity is more complex. © 2009 British Association for Psychopharmacology.

T1  - Central nervous system stimulants: basic pharmacology and relevance to anaesthesia
A1  - Pleuvry B.J. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Convulsants and respiratory stimulant drugs increase reflex excitability but have little effect on mental function. Although many have been used as respiratory stimulants in the past, only doxapram has a sufficiently wide margin of safety to be used for this purpose in modern medicine. The psychomotor stimulants that produce excitement, locomotor stimulation and euphoria are rarely used clinically for this purpose, but they can cause unpredictable hypotension and modified responses to other drugs if they are being misused by a patient who then presents for anaesthesia and surgery. Methylphenidate and dexamphetamine can be useful in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dexamphetamine and modafinil can be useful in narcolepsy. Cocaine is still used as a local anaesthetic in ear, nose and throat surgery, and ephedrine, which is a psychomotor stimulant in high doses, is used to raise the blood pressure if hypotension occurs during surgery. Aminophylline is used to treat apnoea in preterm infants. Psychotomimetic drugs have no clinical use, but can cause problems in patients undergoing anaesthesia. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Improving introspection to inform free will regarding the choice by healthy individuals to use or not use cognitive enhancing drugs
A1  - Thaler D.S. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - A commentary in Nature entitled "Towards responsible use of cognitive-enhancing drugs by the healthy" (Greely et al 2008 Nature 456: 702-705) offers an opportunity to move toward a humane societal appreciation of mind-altering drugs. Using cognitive enhancing drugs as an exemplar, this article presents a series of hypotheses concerning how an individual might learn optimal use. The essence of the proposal is that individuals can cultivate sensitivity to the effects of ever-smaller amounts of psychoactive drugs thereby making harm less likely and benign effects more probable. Four interrelated hypotheses are presented and briefly discussed. 1. Humans can learn to discriminate ever-smaller doses of at least some mind-altering drugs; a learning program can be designed or discovered that will have this outcome. 2. The skill to discriminate drugs and dose can be generalized, i.e. if learned with one drug a second one is easier and so on. 3. Cultivating this skill/knack would be beneficial in leading to choices informed by a more accurate sense of mind-body interactions. 4. From a philosophical point of view learning the effects of ever-smaller doses of psychoactive agents offers a novel path into and to transcend the objective/ subjective barrier and the mind/body problem. Whatever the fate of these specific hypotheses, discussion of cognitive enhancing drugs for healthy individuals has the potential to inspire innovative educational and public policy initiatives toward all types of mind-altering drugs and the people who use them. © 2009 Thaler; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

T1  - Agonist-trafficking and hallucinogens
A1  - Gonzalez-Maeso J.
A1  - Sealfon S.C. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Seven transmembrane domain receptors, also termed G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), represent the most common molecular target for therapeutic drugs. The generally accepted pharmacological model for GPCR activation is the ternary complex model, in which GPCRs exist in a dynamic equilibrium between the active and inactive conformational states. However, the demonstration that different agonists sometimes elicit a different relative activation of two signaling pathways downstream of the same receptor has led to a revision of the ternary complex model. According to this agonist-trafficking model, agonists stabilize distinct activated receptor conformations that preferentially activate specific signaling pathways. Hallucinogenic drugs and non-hallucinogenic drugs represent an attractive experimental system with which to study agonist-trafficking of receptor signaling. Thus many of the behavioral responses induced by hallucinogenic drugs, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin or mescaline, depend on activation of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (5-HT2ARs). In contrast, this neuropsychological state in humans is not induced by closely related chemicals, such as lisuride or ergotamine, despite their similar in vitro activity at the 5-HT2AR. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge, as well as unresolved questions, regarding agonist-trafficking and the mechanism of action of hallucinogenic drugs. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N2  - Aims: To present the prevalence and correlates of hallucinogen use disorders (HUDs: abuse or dependence) and subthreshold dependence. Methods: The study sample included adolescents aged 12-17 years (N = 55,286) who participated in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2004-2006). Data were collected with a combination of computer-assisted personal interviewing and audio computer-assisted self-interviewing. Results: The overall prevalence of HUDs among adolescents was low (<1%). However, more than one in three (38.5%) MDMA users and nearly one in four (24.1%) users of other hallucinogens reported HUD symptoms. MDMA users were more likely than users of other hallucinogens to meet criteria for hallucinogen dependence: 11% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.24-14.81) vs. 3.5% (95% CI: 2.22-5.43). Compared with hallucinogen use only, subthreshold dependence was associated with being female (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.8 [95% CI: 1.08-2.89]), ages 12-13 years (AOR = 3.4 [1.64-7.09]), use of hallucinogens >=52 days (AOR = 2.4 [1.66-6.92]), and alcohol use disorder (AOR = 1.8 [1.21-2.77]). Compared with subthreshold dependence, abuse was associated with mental health service use (AOR = 1.7 [1.00-3.00]) and opioid use disorder (AOR = 4.9 [1.99-12.12]); dependence was associated with MDMA use (AOR = 2.2 [1.05-4.77]), mental health service use (AOR = 2.9 [1.34-6.06]), and opioid use disorder (AOR = 2.6 [1.01-6.90]). MDMA users had a higher prevalence of most other substance use disorders than users of non-hallucinogen drugs. Conclusions: Adolescent MDMA users appear to be particularly at risk for exhibiting hallucinogen dependence and other substance use disorders. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - Chemical interactions with pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the cerebral cortex: Control of pain and anxiety
A1  - Adams Jr. J.D. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the cerebral cortex are involved in learning and memory and have complex connections with other neurons through a very large array of dendrites. These dendrites can switch between long term depression and long term potentiation depending on global summation of various inputs. The plasticity of the input into pyramidal neurons makes the neuronal output variable. Many interneurons in the cerebral cortex and distant neurons in other brain regions are involved in providing input to pyramidal neurons. All of these neurons and interneurons have neurotransmitters that act through receptors to provide input to pyramidal neurons. Serotonin is one of the important neurotransmitters involved with pyramidal neurons and has been implicated in psychosis, psychedelic states and what are called sacred dreams. This review will discuss the various chemicals and receptors that are important with pyramidal neurons including opioids, nicotine, scopolamine, psilocybin, LSD, mescaline, ergot alkaloids, salvinorin A, ergine and other compounds that interact with opioid, nicotinic, muscarinic and serotonergic receptors. The natural compounds provide clues to structure activity relationships with the receptors. It has been postulated that each receptor in the body has a natural agonist and antagonist, in addition to the normal neurotransmitters. It is common for natural antagonists and agonists to be peptides. Various possible peptide structures will be proposed for natural antagonists and agonists at each receptor. Natural antagonists and agonists may provide new ways to explore the functions of pyramidal neurons in normal health and pain management. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N2  - The use of high-temperature liquid chromatography with sub-2m particle C18 columns is described for the analysis of seized drugs. The drug compounds investigated include narcotic analgesics, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and anabolic steroids. Although retention times for 20 solutes of various drug classes decreased with increased temperature (15-95C) under constant gradient conditions, relative retention times increased, decreased, or remained the same. No significant sample degradation at elevated temperature was observed. The use of rapid gradients at 95C was well suited for drug screening and the separation of anabolic steroids.

N2  - Introduction: The use of illicit drugs by students and the possible psychological repercussions in this population of young adults is an important public health issue. While some data in the literature suggest a relationship between cannabis and the occurrence of mental health disorders, and in particular psychotic illnesses, epidemiologic surveys have shown that cannabis is the most consumed illicit drug in France. Aim of the study: To carry out a quantitative and qualitative epidemiological investigation of substance use within a student population seen during their mandatory preventive health visit at the University medical facility. Method: Students were asked to take part in an investigation of their substance consumption and their individual experiences with cannabis in particular. Personality autoquestionnaires were performed and the psychotomimetic effects of cannabis were investigated with substance use within a student population seen during their mandatory preventive health visit at the University medical facility. Results: A total of 3 807 students took part in the survey with a response rate of approximately 50%. Preliminary results relating to a subsample of this study are presented here (n = 880, mean age 20 years, 65% women). 44% of the students consumed cannabis at least once in their life. The prevalence of regular consumption in students (at least once a week) was of 18%, 11% had periods of daily or close to daily consumptions, and 13% used cannabis in the last month. For each of the drugs cocaine, ecstasy (MDMA), and mushrooms (psilocybin) the prevalence of experimentation (at least once) was 5% for cocaine, 4% for ecstasy and mushrooms, and for LSD the rate was 1,5%. Other evaluated substances had a prevalence of consumption lower than 1%. For the first cannabis consumptions, a majority of students state to felt <> effects : relaxation (71%) and euphoria (53%). 13% state to have felt effects of anxiety or sadness. 25% admit having had difficulties of expression, 24% memory deficits, 35% trouble with coordination or balance and 39% difficulties of concentration. Approximately 16% had impressions of depersonalization and derealization. Lastly, some experienced <> effects such as visual (10%) and auditory (6%) hallucinations, as well as referential ideas (16%), mistrust or feelings of persecution (11%). 26% of the student sample had felt at least one of these last four <> effects. Discussion: The results are consistent with the idea that the impact of cannabis consumption is highly variable among different consumers. Implications for prevention strategies are discussed such as educational interventions based on recognition and motivation for change. © L'Encephale, 2009.

T1  - A new classification of prodrugs: Regulatory perspectives
A1  - Wu K.-M. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Many therapeutic agents are manufactured and administered in prodrug forms. In this paper, a new classification system for prodrugs is proposed to provide useful information about where in the body a prodrug is converted to the active drug. In this system, prodrugs are classified into Type I or Type II and the respective Subtypes IA, IB, IIA, IIB or IIC based on their sites of conversion into the final active drug form. For Type I prodrugs, conversion occurs intracellularly (e.g., antiviral nucleoside analogs, lipid-lowering statins), whereas conversion of Type II prodrugs occurs extracellularly, for examples in digestive fluids, systemic circulation or other extracellular body fluids (e.g., etoposide phosphate, valganciclovir, fosamprenavir). Type IA prodrugs refer to those that are converted at the cellular targets of therapeutic actions, whereas Type IB prodrugs' conversion occurs in the primary metabolic tissues such as liver, gut, or lung. For Type II prodrugs, the conversion process could either take place extracellularly in the milieu of gastrointestinal fluids (Type IIA), in the systemic circulation and/or other systemic extracellular fluid compartments (Type IIB), or near therapeutical target cells (Type IIC). A prodrug may belong to multiple categories and be recognized as a Mixed-Type prodrug. For example a prodrug may be converted both in target cells and metabolic tissues such as liver (i.e., named as a Type IA/IB prodrug), or one converted in both GI fluids and systemic circulations (i.e., named as a Type IIA/IIB prodrug). The Mixed-Type compound can be further distinguished as a Parallel Mixed-Type or Sequential Mixed-Type prodrug depending on the conversion processes that proceed with, either in concurrent or in sequential steps. Because traditional analysis of drug actions has always been focused on the site of action and mode of action, the proposed classification of prodrugs based on cellular locations of conversion is in line with current thought processes of regulatory review and risk assessment of both prodrug and active drug. By gaining insights regarding the site of action through prodrug nomenclature, risk benefit evaluation can be made more efficiently because both information on kinetics and impact of tissues involved are adequately revealed through prodrug subtype designated. In conclusion, the new system of classification will add to existing knowledge of prodrug classifications, and will provide improved insight into the contributory roles of both prodrug and active drug in the product's efficacy and safety, and their risk-benefit assessment. © 2009 by the authors.

N2  - [18F]altanserin is the preferred radiotracer for in-vivo labeling of serotonin 2A receptors by positron emission tomography (PET). We report a modified synthesis procedure suited for reliable production of multi-GBq amounts of [18F]altanserin useful for application in humans. We introduced thermal heating for drying of [18F]fluoride as well as for the reaction instead of microwave heating. We furthermore describe solid phase extraction and HPLC procedures for quantitative determination of [18F]altanserin and metabolites in plasma. The time course of arterial plasma activity with and without metabolite correction was determined. 90 min after bolus injection, 38.4% of total plasma activity derived from unchanged [18F]altanserin. Statistical comparison of kinetic profiles of [18F]altanserin metabolism in plasma samples collected in the course of two ongoing studies employing placebo, the serotonin releaser dexfenfluramine and the hallucinogen psilocybin, revealed the same tracer metabolism. We conclude that metabolite analysis for correction of individual plasma input functions used in tracer modeling is not necessary for [18F]altanserin studies involving psilocybin or dexfenfluramine treatment. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Hallucinogens as discriminative stimuli in animals: LSD, phenethylamines, and tryptamines
A1  - Winter J.C. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Background: Although man's first encounters with hallucinogens predate written history, it was not until the rise of the sister disciplines of organic chemistry and pharmacology in the nineteenth century that scientific studies became possible. Mescaline was the first to be isolated and its chemical structure determined. Since then, additional drugs have been recovered from their natural sources and synthetic chemists have contributed many more. Given their profound effects upon human behavior and the need for verbal communication to access many of these effects, some see humans as ideal subjects for study of hallucinogens. However, if we are to determine the mechanisms of action of these agents, establish hypotheses testable in human subjects, and explore the mechanistic links between hallucinogens and such apparently disparate topics as idiopathic psychosis, transcendental states, drug abuse, stress disorders, and cognitive dysfunction, studies in animals are essential. Stimulus control by hallucinogens has provided an intuitively attractive approach to the study of these agents in nonverbal species. Objective: The intent of this review is to provide a brief account of events from the time of the first demonstration of hallucinogen-induced stimulus control to the present. In general, the review is limited to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and the hallucinogenic derivatives of phenethylamine and tryptamine. Results: The pharmacological basis for stimulus control by LSD and hallucinogenic phenethylamines and tryptamines is serotonergic in nature. The 5-HT2A receptor appears to be the primary site of action with significant modulation by other serotonergic sites including 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptors. Interactions with other neurotransmitters, especially glutamate and dopamine, are under active investigation. Most studies to date have been conducted in the rat but transgenic mice offer interesting possibilities. Conclusions: Hallucinogen-induced stimulus control provides a unique behavioral tool for the prediction of subjective effects in man and for the elucidation of the pharmacological mechanisms of the action of these agents. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - OBJECTIVE:: To estimate the prevalence, distribution, and correlates of drug use among middle aged and elderly persons in the United States and to compare with alcohol use in this age group. SETTING:: The 2005 and 2006 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. PARTICIPANTS:: A total of 10,953 subjects, age 50 years and older (6,717 subjects age 50-64 years and 4,236 subjects age 65+ years). MEASUREMENTS:: Social and demographic variables detailed assessment of alcohol and drug use and disorders (marijuana, cocaine, inhalants, hallucinogens, methamphetamine, and heroin), major depression, and self-rated health. RESULTS:: Nearly 60% of subjects used alcohol during the past year, 2.6% marijuana, and 0.41% cocaine. Both alcohol and drug use were far more frequent in subjects age 50-64 years and among men. Drug use, in contrast to alcohol use, was not associated with education but was more common among those not married and those with major depression. The prevalence of drug abuse or dependence in the 50+ age group was very low (only 0.33% for any abuse or dependence, 0.12% for marijuana abuse or dependence, and 0.18% for cocaine abuse or dependence). Nevertheless, the use of marijuana approached 4% in the 50-64 age group in comparison with 0.7% in the 65+ age group. CONCLUSIONS:: Drug use is not prevalent, although use is much more common in the middle aged, suggesting that prevalence may rise substantially in the 65+ age group as the younger cohort ages. © 2009 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

N2  - The OAV-Questionnaire is a visual analogue scale with 66 items that measures 3 aetiology-independent dimensions of altered states of consciousness (ASC's): 'Oceanic Boundlessness' (OSE), 'Dread of Ego Dissolution' (AIA) and 'Visual Restructuralization' (VUS). It is a psychometrically improved version of the APZ-Questionnaire, which has become the international standard for the assessment of ASCs. In this study, the factorial structure and reliability of the OAV-Questionnaire was critically examined using a large pooled dataset from a series of psychological and psychophysiological investigations between 1992 and 2008 in which ASCs were induced in healthy volunteers by either psilocybin (115-350 mug/kg p.o.) (n = 323), ketamine (6-12 mug/kg min i.v.) (n = 162) or MDMA (1.5-1.7 mg/kg p.o.) (n = 102). Principal factor analysis with three factors and oblique rotation distributed 90% of the items to their hypothesized factor in the psilocybin and in the combined drug group. However, VUS-items measuring facilitated recollection, imagination and changed meaning of percepts loaded higher on the OAV-factor than on the VUS-factor in all drug-sub-groups. Furthermore, scree-plot and parallel-analysis suggested that more than 3 factors have to be extracted to account for the variance between the items. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with simple structure clearly rejected the original factorial structure and disproved unidimensionality in all scales with the strongest rejection in the VUS-scale. We developed an improved model with 9 factors measured by 47 items. Multiple Group CFA and MIMIC-Modelling demonstrated acceptable model fit and partial measurement invariance in all drug-subgroups. Satisfactory homogeneity and reliability of these newly developed scales could also be confirmed in all available data sets. We suggest to revise the existing factorial structure according to our newly developed model.

N2  - Background: The preferential 5-HT2A/1A agonist psilocybin is known for its ability to induce a short and transient psychotic state in normals including visual hallucinations that resembles some of the signs and symptoms of insipient and/or acute episodes of schizophrenia. In schizophrenia both reduced 5-HT2A receptor density and disturbances in visual processing such as modal object completion associated with decrements in the P1 and/or N170 component have been reported. However, whether aberrant 5-HT2A/1A receptor neurotransmission is directly linked to deficits in object completion in schizophrenia is not known. Aim/Methods: To further investigate the role of 5-HT2A/1A receptors in visual processing and hallucinations the effect of psilocybin (115 mug/and 215 mug/kg vs placebo) on modal object completion has been assessed using the Kanizsa figures and high-density electrical mapping and source-analysis (LORETA) in normal volunteers (n = 17). Results: We found that psilocybin dose-dependently impaired modal object completion associated with a preferential reduction of the N170 amplitude to the Kanizsa relative to Non-Kanizsa stimuli in occipital cortex (LOC). This finding was supported by an additional behavioural visual detection task. Moreover, the overall reduction of the N170 amplitude in the Kanizsa and the non-Kanizsa condition correlated with the degree of psilocybin-induced visual hallucinations. Conclusion: These results suggest that a disruption of the serotonergic neurotrans-mission, particularly at the level of the 5-HT2A/1A receptor, leads to visual hallucinations and aberrant modal object completion by modulating the N170 component. Given that similar disruptions were found in schizophrenic patients the present results suggest that interferences at the level the 5-HT2A/1A receptor may underlay the aberrant object completion found in schizophrenia.

N2  - The serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) receptor has been implicated in both the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and the psychotropic properties of serotonergic hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin. However, it is still unclear which brain regions are involved in altered states of consciousness during psychosis and hallucinogenic drug action. Thus, we investigated the role of 5-HT2Areceptors in the hallucinogenic effects of the 5-HT2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin with [18 F]altanserin positron emission tomography (PET). Eleven healthy male subjects received placebo and a single dose of 215 mug/kg of psilocybin separated by an interval of 14 days. Seventy-five min later, 250 MBq of the 5-HT2A receptor selective PET-radiotracer [18 F]altanserin were administered intravenously as a 30 sec bolus. Dynamic PET data were subsequently acquired over 90 min. Hallucinogenic drug action was assessed by the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D-ASC). Psilocybin strongly decreased the total distribution volume (DV) of [18F]altanserin in all investigated brain regions (mean+/-SD 35 +/- 13%), most pronounced in the insula and the frontal and anterior cingulate cortex. The increase of 5D-ASC global scores was correlated with the decrease of [18 F]altanserin DV within the anterior cingulate and the medial prefrontal cortex, the insula and the superior temporal cortex. In concert with animal data, these results indicate that 5-HT2A receptor populations in the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex are involved in the development of altered states of consciousness induced by serotonin hallucinogens. Addressing the model psychosis paradigm, these receptor populations may also play a role in the development of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia.

N2  - Objectives: An open-label trial of the ergot-based non-hallucinogen 2-bromo-LSD (BOL) for the treatment of episodic and chronic cluster headache. Background: Anecdotal patient reports as well as a clinical case series led by one of the authors (JHH) describe attack cessation, early termination of attack series, and remission induction/extension in cluster headache patients who self-administer the hallucinogens LSD and/or psilocybin. Evaluation of a non-hallucinogenic analog could clarify whether these reported effects are associated with hallucinogenicity or are due to other chemotherapeutic mechanisms. Methods: 4 subjects with active cluster headache refractory to standard treatments were administered in an outpatient research setting in Hannover, Germany approximately 30 mug/kg of BOL on 3 separate occasions separated by 5 days. Subjects maintained a headache diary prior to and post treatments for at least two months. The Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) was obtained at baseline and follow- up interviews. (Table Presented) Results: Subject 2 reported a 30% reduction in pain intensity for 2 months after final BOL treatment and a 73% reduction in attack frequency for 4 months; the other three subjects report complete or nearly complete remission of all headache symptoms for at least 2 months after final BOL treatment. Conclusions: If the hallucinogens psilocybin and LSD have important treatment effects for cluster headache, BOL - a non-hallucinogenic analog of LSD - may be safer for further research as indicated by these findings. Though open-label, BOL may be the first non-hallucinogenic agent identified to significantly modify the course of living with this severely debilitating disease.

T1  - Serotonin research: contributions to understanding psychoses

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The history of serotonin research is closely related to the study of hallucinogenic drugs that function as agonists at serotonin-2A receptors. The fundamental idea that psychotic states seen in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia might be attributable, in part, to abnormalities in serotonergic systems began with the almost simultaneous discovery of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and serotonin. Sixty years of study have confirmed early speculations regarding the important relationship between serotonin and both drug-induced and disorder-based psychotic states. Now, modern biochemical, pharmacological, behavioral, neuroimaging, genetic and molecular biological sciences are converging to understand how serotonergic systems interact with other monoaminergic and glutamatergic systems to modulate states of consciousness and contribute to psychotic disorders such as the group of schizophrenias. This review summarizes experimental assessments of the serotonergic hallucinogen model psychosis in relation to the serotonin hypothesis of schizophrenia.

N2  - The psychosis associated with schizophrenia is characterized by alterations in sensory processing and perception. Some antipsychotic drugs were identified by their high affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (2AR). Drugs that interact with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) also have potential for the treatment of schizophrenia. The effects of hallucinogenic drugs, such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide, require the 2AR and resemble some of the core symptoms of schizophrenia. Here we show that the mGluR2 interacts through specific transmembrane helix domains with the 2AR, a member of an unrelated G-protein-coupled receptor family, to form functional complexes in brain cortex. The 2AR-mGluR2 complex triggers unique cellular responses when targeted by hallucinogenic drugs, and activation of mGluR2 abolishes hallucinogen-specific signalling and behavioural responses. In post-mortem human brain from untreated schizophrenic subjects, the 2AR is upregulated and the mGluR2 is downregulated, a pattern that could predispose to psychosis. These regulatory changes indicate that the 2AR-mGluR2 complex may be involved in the altered cortical processes of schizophrenia, and this complex is therefore a promising new target for the treatment of psychosis. ©2008 Nature Publishing Group.

N2  - Psilocybe semilanceata belongs to the genus of Psilocybe; it is a hallucinogenic fungus, frequently found in regions with high rainfall, in the grass and moss. There are estimated to be as many as eight Psilocybe hallucinogenic species containing psychoactive alkaloids, such as psilocybin and psilocin, which may cause visual, auditory and other hallucinations, as well as profound changes in the perception of time and space. Since identification of P semilanceata in a form different than a fresh mushroom is almost impossible, the authors made an attempt at developing a method of fungi identification based on the PCR technique, which could be helpful in a fight against dangerous consumption of these hallucinogens by the youth. Detection of the specific DNA sequence for P semilanceata brought good results; the test may be commonly employed in forensic practice in the future.

N2  - Natural hallucinogens (including Psilocybe mushrooms) became popular in Europe since the nineties. They have been in the focus of clinicians interest for years because of their biological effects. Mechanism of action of these hallucinogens, both Psilocin and Psilocibin, is based on the physiological structure similarity to human neurotransmitters as serotonin and catecholamines. One of the previous works indicated the possibility of the cardiotoxic action of the Psilocibin mushroom, effecting in anoxemic heart laesure. To verify the hypothesis of the Psilocibin-like myocardial damage wide experimental programme was designed. In the present work we introduce some results concerning magnesium, calcium, natrium, kalium and chloride plasma concentration in rats subjected subchronicly to psilocin and phenylethylamine. Basing on the obtained results, it can be stated that subchronic intoxication with natural hallucinogens may disturb magnesium balance without significantly effecting other microelements.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder consisting of obsessions and compulsions. Over the past two decades, it has been suggested that OCD might be related to the functioning of brain serotonin systems, mainly because of the antiobsessional efficacy of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Although the efficacy of SSRIs suggests a role of the serotonergic system in OCD, the exact function of serotonin is still unclear. Is the serotonergic system implicated in the pathophysiology of OCD, or is it implicated in the treatment effect in OCD? Do SSRIs compensate for a fundamental abnormality of the serotonergic system, or do SSRIs modulate an intact serotonergic system to compensate for another neurotransmitter mechanism? This review summarizes evidence supporting a role for the serotonin transporter and serotonin receptor subtypes in the pathophysiology and treatment of OCD. © 2008 Future Medicine Ltd.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - We used the MembStruk computational procedure to predict the three-dimensional (3D) structure for the serotonin 5-HT2C G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Using this structure, we used the MSCDock computational procedure to predict the 3D structures for bound ligand-protein complexes for agonists such as serotonin and antagonists such as ritanserin, metergoline, and methiothepin. In addition, we predicted the SAR data for a series of psilocybin analogs, both agonists and antagonists. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) on serotonin bound to 5-HT2C and we find the protein and binding site to be stable after 5 ns. We find good agreement with the currently known experimental data and we predict a number of new mutations which could be used to validate further our predicted structures. This agreement between theory and experiment suggests that our 3D structure is sufficiently accurate for use in drug design. We also compare a preliminary prediction for 5-HT2B with our prediction for 5-HT2C and find a difference in TM5 that contributes to different serotonin binding modes in 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Rationale: Many studies have reported deficits of mismatch negativity (MMN) in schizophrenic patients. Pharmacological challenges with hallucinogens in healthy humans are used as models for psychotic states. Previous studies reported a significant reduction of MMN after ketamine (N-methyl-d-aspartate acid [NMDA] antagonist model) but not after psilocybin (5HT2A agonist model). Objectives: The aim of the present study was to directly compare the two models of psychosis using an intraindividual crossover design. Materials and methods: Fifteen healthy subjects participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study with a low and a high dose of the 5HT2A agonist dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and the NMDA antagonist S-ketamine. During electroencephalographic recording, the subjects were performing the AX-version of a continuous performance test (AX-CPT). A source analysis of MMN was performed on the basis of a four-source model of MMN generation. Results: Nine subjects completed both experimental days with the two doses of both drugs. Overall, we found blunted MMN and performance deficits in the AX-CPT after both drugs. However, the reduction in MMN activity was overall more pronounced after S-ketamine intake, and only S-ketamine had a significant impact on the frontal source of MMN. Conclusions: The NDMA antagonist model and the 5HT2A agonist model of psychosis display distinct neurocognitive profiles. These findings are in line with the view of the two classes of hallucinogens modeling different aspects of psychosis. © 2008 The Author(s).

T1  - Harmonic oscillators: The quantization of simple systems in the old quantum theory and their functional roles in biology
A1  - Steele R.H. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - This article introduces quantum physics into biology in an intuitive and non-intimidating manner. It extends the quantum aspects of harmonic oscillators, and electromagnetic fields, to their functional roles in biology. Central to this process are the De Broglie wave-particle duality equation, and the adiabatic invariant parameters, magnetic moment, angular momentum and magnetic flux, determined by Ehrenfest as imposing quantum constraints on the dynamics of charges in motion. In mechanisms designed to explain the generation of low-level light emissions in biology we have adopted a biological analog of the electrical circuitry modeled on the parallel plated capacitor, traversed by helical protein structures, capable of generating electromagnetic radiation in the optical spectral region. The charge carrier required for the emissions is an accelerating electron driven, in a cyclotron-type mechanism, by ATP-induced reverse electron transfer with the radial, emission, components, mediated by coulombic forces within the helical configurations. Adenine, an essential nucleotide constituent of DNA, was examined with its long wavelength absorption maximum determining the energetic parameters for the calculations. The calculations were made for a virtual 5-turn helix where each turn of the helix emits a different frequency, generating a biological quantum series. The components of six adiabatic invariant equations were found to be embedded in Planck's constant rendering them discrete, finite, non-random, non-statistical - Planck's constant precludes probability. A mechanism for drug-induced hallucination is described that might provide insights as to the possible role of electromagnetic fields in consciousness. Sodium acceleration through a proposed nerve membrane helical channel generated electromagnetic emissions in the microwave region in confirmation of reported microwave emission for active nerves and may explain saltatory nerve conduction. Theoretical calculations for a helical DNA system gave a conduction resistance in agreement with a experimentally determined parameter. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2008.

N2  - Psilocybin has been used for centuries for religious purposes; however, little is known scientifically about its long-term effects. We previously reported the effects of a double-blind study evaluating the psychological effects of a high psilocybin dose. This report presents the 14-month follow-up and examines the relationship of the follow-up results to data obtained at screening and on drug session days. Participants were 36 hallucinogen-naive adults reporting regular participation in religious/ spiritual activities. Oral psilocybin (30 mg/70 kg) was administered on one of two or three sessions, with methylphenidate (40 mg/70 kg) administered on the other session(s). During sessions, volunteers were encouraged to close their eyes and direct their attention inward. At the 14-month follow-up, 58% and 67%, respectively, of volunteers rated the psilocybin-occasioned experience as being among the five most personally meaningful and among the five most spiritually significant experiences of their lives; 64% indicated that the experience increased well-being or life satisfaction; 58% met criteria for having had a 'complete' mystical experience. Correlation and regression analyses indicated a central role of the mystical experience assessed on the session day in the high ratings of personal meaning and spiritual significance at follow-up. Of the measures of personality, affect, quality of life and spirituality assessed across the study, only a scale measuring mystical experience showed a difference from screening. When administered under supportive conditions, psilocybin occasioned experiences similar to spontaneously occurring mystical experiences that, at 14-month follow-up, were considered by volunteers to be among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant of their lives. © 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology.

T1  - Human hallucinogen research: Guidelines for safety

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - There has recently been a renewal of human research with classical hallucinogens (psychedelics). This paper first briefly discusses the unique history of human hallucinogen research, and then reviews the risks of hallucinogen administration and safeguards for minimizing these risks. Although hallucinogens are relatively safe physiologically and are not considered drugs of dependence, their administration involves unique psychological risks. The most likely risk is overwhelming distress during drug action ('bad trip'), which could lead to potentially dangerous behaviour such as leaving the study site. Less common are prolonged psychoses triggered by hallucinogens. Safeguards against these risks include the exclusion of volunteers with personal or family history of psychotic disorders or other severe psychiatric disorders, establishing trust and rapport between session monitors and volunteer before the session, careful volunteer preparation, a safe physical session environment and interpersonal support from at least two study monitors during the session. Investigators should probe for the relatively rare hallucinogen persisting perception disorder in follow-up contact. Persisting adverse reactions are rare when research is conducted along these guidelines. Incautious research may jeopardize participant safety and future research. However, carefully conducted research may inform the treatment of psychiatric disorders, and may lead to advances in basic science. © 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology.

N2  - Diverse forms of drug use are an emerging theme within research on young people and substance use. This manuscript, based on a three city study of health risks amongst young injection drug users, explores multiple drug use and polydrug use amongst a subset of homeless youth referred to as travelers. In particular, we outline characteristics of homeless traveler youths and the various ways in which they practiced multiple drug use and polydrug use. From here, we discusssome theoretical and public health implications of multiple drug use and polydrug use amongst this particular population. © 2008 by The Haworth Press. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the current research on hallucinogen induced psychiatric disorders. In addition to LSD and psilocybin hallucinogens of biologic origin are increasingly used by adolescents and young adults. Methods: Relevant literature and related articles were identified by means of a computerized MEDLINE search including the years 1997-2007. As keywords "hallucinogen induced psychosis", "hallucinogen induced flashback", "hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD)" were used. Finally, 64 journal articles and books out of 103 were included in the review. Results: Acute psychotic syndromes in adolescents are rarely due to intoxications with hallucinogenic drugs. However, clinical relevance of flashback phenomena as post-hallucinogenic psychiatric disorder has to be disputed. Because of the high popularity of biogenic hallucinogens and LSD knowledge of intoxications and resulting psychiatric disorders as well as medical complications and therapeutical approaches are clinically important. Especially intoxications with drugs of herbal origin like tropanalcaloids play an important role in emergency situations. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

N2  - Background: Street-involved youth have been shown to be involved in the street-level illicit drug trade in a number of jurisdictions, though little is known about risk factors and sequelae of this behavior. The present study was therefore conducted to investigate factors associated with the street-level drug trade involvement among street-based youth. Methods: We used logistic regression to examine factors associated with drug dealing among participants in the At-Risk Youth Study in Vancouver, Canada. We also examined motivations for drug trade involvement and types of drugs sold by participants. Results: Overall, 529 street-involved youth were followed during the study period, of whom 307 (58.0%) reported having been involved in the drug trade in the last six months. In a logistic regression analysis, crack cocaine use (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.28-2.67), homelessness (AOR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.04-2.40), and having been assaulted by police (AOR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.14-3.00) were independently associated with drug dealing among cohort participants. Among participants who reported drug dealing, 263 (85.6%) individuals stated that the main reason that they sold drugs was to pay for their personal drug use. Conclusions: In our setting, street-involved youth implicated in the drug trade are characterized by drug-related and sociodemographic vulnerabilities. These individuals also appear to be motivated by drug dependence and report elevated levels of police violence. Our findings have immediate implications for drug strategies targeting street-level drug dealing. Copyright © Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Hallucinogens represent the group of psychotropics, which induce characteristic cognitive, perceptual and emotional symptoms. Hallucinogens are represented by indolamines (psilocybin or DMT), ergoline derivatives with indole nucleus (LSD), and substituted phenylethylamines (mescaline). The clinical effect of hallucinogens is similar to the antagonists of NMDA glutamatergic receptors (ketamine, phencyclidine and MK-801). The effect of hallucinogens is mediated by the agonism on serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT1A a 5-HT2C receptors with subsequent change of activity of pyramidal glutamatergic neurons and by direct or indirect changes in dopaminergic and noradrenergic activity. The mechanisms of action of hallucinogens and NMDA antagonists overlap in changes induced in glutamatergic and monoaminergic systems. Studies of overlapping mechanisms of action of hallucinogens and NMDA antagonists represent important tool for the research in the field of pathophysiology of mental disorders (schizophrenia) and antipsychotic action.

N2  - Memory, attention and creativity represent three different cognitive domains, which are interconnected and contribute the "mental performance" of an individual. Modern neuroscience has investigated some of the neuronal circuits and of the neurotransmitters and molecular events underlying the above-mentioned cognitive functions. Within this renewed reference context, some of the properties of the components of the remedies to increase mental performance have been studied and validated in experimental models and, to date, these substances are named "smart drugs", "memory enhancing drugs" or "nootropic drugs" (from the Greek root noos for mind and tropein for toward). Recently pharmaceutical industries are increasingly focusing on the research for potential substances in this field: several "smart drugs" are in clinical trials and could be on the market in few years. Furthermore, a quick survey from Internet highlights the presence of a great variety of both approved and non-approved drugs, with some of them addressing to only medical and others to performance-oriented use, opening room to some reflections or speculations from scientific and ethical points of view. In order to point out the effect of nootropic drugs on cognition of healthy people, we reviewed the literature on drug enhancement of various cognitive functions, including memory, attention and creativity. As their simplest, memory is regarded as the ability to remember events or learned material, attention is the cognitive process of selectively concentrating on one aspect while ignoring distracters and creativity could be described as the ability to create products or ideas which are original and which possess a social usefulness. Reports from literature reveal that some medications currently available to patients with memory disorders may also increase performances in healthy people and that drugs designed for psychiatric disorders can also be used to enhance certain mental functions. However, the long-term effects of these drugs are unknown, but their apparent effectiveness allows room to their use and misuse. At variance with these literature data showing scientific, even if poor, evidence of the effect of smart drugs in the field of memory and attention, only indirect information on creativity can be obtained by studies of the effects of diseases and drugs on the artistic productivity of classic painters and famous authors, offering a link to understand the neuronal basis of this cognitive function and a cue to understand how drugs (used to correct the illness) may affect the function. On the basis of these cues, in this review we will discuss some critical aspects of the different cerebral circuits and molecular events regulating memory, attention and creativity in order to outline the neurobiological bases of the effects of "smart drugs" on cognitive functions, and to evaluate their putative pharmaceutical development. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Action of a hallucinogenic substance, psilocybin, on internal time representation was investigated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: Experiment 1 with 12 subjects and graded doses, and Experiment 2 with 9 subjects and a very low dose. The task consisted in repeated reproductions of time intervals in the range from 1.5 to 5 s. The effects were assessed by parameter kappa of the 'dual klepsydra' model of internal time representation, fitted to individual response data and intra-individually normalized with respect to initial values. The estimates over(kappa, ) were in the same order of magnitude as in earlier studies. In both experiments, kappa was significantly increased by psilocybin at 90 min from the drug intake, indicating a higher loss rate of the internal duration representation. These findings are tentatively linked to qualitative alterations of subjective time in altered states of consciousness. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - Indolealkylamines: Biotransformations and potential drug-drug interactions
A1  - Yu A.-M. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Indolealkylamine (IAA) drugs are 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) analogs that mainly act on the serotonin system. Some IAAs are clinically utilized for antimigraine therapy, whereas other substances are notable as drugs of abuse. In the clinical evaluation of antimigraine triptan drugs, studies on their biotransformations and pharmacokinetics would facilitate the understanding and prevention of unwanted drug-drug interactions (DDIs). A stable, principal metabolite of an IAA drug of abuse could serve as a useful biomarker in assessing intoxication of the IAA substance. Studies on the metabolism of IAA drugs of abuse including lysergic acid amides, tryptamine derivatives and beta-carbolines are therefore emerging. An important role for polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) in the metabolism of IAA drugs of abuse has been revealed by recent studies, suggesting that variations in IAA metabolism, pharmaco- or toxicokinetics and dynamics can arise from distinct CYP2D6 status, and CYP2D6 polymorphism may represent an additional risk factor in the use of these IAA drugs. Furthermore, DDIs with IAA agents could occur additively at the pharmaco/toxicokinetic and dynamic levels, leading to severe or even fatal serotonin toxicity. In this review, the metabolism and potential DDIs of these therapeutic and abused IAA drugs are described. © 2008 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.

N2  - Background: There is increasing evidence that catatonia is an important source of impairment in adolescents and adults with autism. Aim: Review of the evaluation, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment of catatonia in autism. Method: Presentation and discussion of a case-vignette spanning early childhood to adulthood. Results: Autistic and catatonic symptoms overlap, yet catatonia is diagnosable in about one of seven adolescents and young adults with autism. Case-reports suggest that benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy are effective treatments in the acute and maintenance phase for people with autism who develop catatonia. Conclusions: Catatonia should be assessed in people with autism when there is an obvious and marked deterioration in movement, vocalizations, pattern of activities, self-care, and practical skills. Benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy are favored options for acute and maintenance treatment in these cases. Further studies on the possible biological-genetic overlap between autism and catatonia would be helpful. © 2008 Steinkopff Verlag.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Central nervous system (CNS) drug delivery remains a major challenge, despite extensive efforts that have been made to develop novel strategies to overcome obstacles. Prodrugs are bioreversible derivatives of drug molecules that must undergo an enzymatic and/or chemical transformation in vivo to release the active parent drug, which subsequently exerts the desired pharmacological effect. In both drug discovery and drug development, prodrugs have become an established tool for improving physicochemical, biopharmaceutical or pharmacokinetic properties of pharmacologically active agents that overcome barriers to a drug's usefulness. This review provides insight into various prodrug strategies explored to date for CNS drug delivery, including lipophilic prodrugs, carrier- and receptor-mediated prodrug delivery systems, and gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy. © American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists 2008.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - (Chemical Equation Presented) The preparation of pi-rich 2-aryl heterocycles by palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling of sodium heteroarylsilanolates with aryl iodides, bromides, and chlorides is described. The cross-coupling process was developed through extensive optimization of the following key variables: (1) identification of stable, isolable alkali metal silanolates, (2) identification of conditions for preformation and isolation of silanolate salts, (3) judicious choice in the palladium catalyst/ligand combination, and (4) selection of the protecting group on the nitrogen of indole. It was found that the alkali metal silanolates, either isolated or formed in situ, offered a significant rate enhancement and broader substrate scope over the use of silanols activated by Bronsted bases such as NaOt-Bu. In addition, the optimized conditions for the cross-coupling of 2-indolylsilanolates were readily applied to the cross-coupling of 2-pyrrolyl-, 2-furyl-, and 2-thienylsilanolates. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

T1  - Update on the therapy of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias
A1  - Lenaerts M.E. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The treatment of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias requires very careful attention to clinical aspects. It is important to spend enough time assessing the patient to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. Identifying trigger factors (eg, alcohol), when applicable, is part of the therapy, as behavior modifications may be necessary. Cluster headache treatment should never be delayed; patients should be able to visit the clinic within 48 hours to expedite medication initiation. Abortive therapy typically is best achieved with nasal oxygen, sumatriptan injections, or both. Typically, a steroid taper is begun and will be continued for a few days. A prophylactic agent such as verapamil or topiramate also is initiated immediately and will be taken for a period slightly beyond the expected duration of the last cluster period before an attempt is made to taper it off. For chronic cluster headache, lithium carbonate is recommended after a few weeks if these other treatments have failed. If more than three regimens of medical therapy fail, patients should be considered for neurostimulation procedures. Paroxysmal hemicrania most often responds to indomethacin. Failure may be due to a dosage that is too low. Gastric protection should always be given, because this medication has a high rate of gastric complications. Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) remain very difficult to treat. Lamotrigine is the first recommendation. Overall, one of the most crucial aspects of the management of patients with these disabling headache syndromes is patient education regarding what their disorder is and the reasoning behind the therapeutic options offered.

T1  - Between prohibitions: Patterns and meanings of magic mushroom use in the UK
A1  - Riley S.C.E.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - A survey of magic mushroom use was completed by 174 participants in 2004, a year when the sale of hallucinogenic mushrooms was not illegal in the UK. The data were collected in Edinburgh and Bristol (UK). Participants were a self-selecting convenience sample. Participants tended to be in their 20s, White-British, in education or employed; 64% were male. Participants reported a pattern of infrequent but intense consumption (47% used between 4-12 times/year, average consumption in one setting was 12 g, a high dose). Use was explained in terms of laughing, hallucinations, altering perspective (41-74%), and feelings of being closer to nature (49%). Negative experiences reported included paranoia (35%) and anxiety (32%). Mushroom use was located within a wider recreational drug and alcohol culture. Four focus groups aided the interpretation of the data. Future research is recommended into negative experiences. Implications for policy and harm minimisation literature are discussed.

T1  - Depersonalization disorder: Pharmacological approaches
A1  - Sierra M. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Depersonalization disorder (DPD) is a chronic and distressing condition with a prevalence in the general population between 0.8 and 2%. Several neurobiological studies in the last decade have shown that patients have suppressed limbic activation to emotional stimuli. Such findings are in line with a model which suggests that the condition is generated by an anxiety-triggered, 'hard-wired' inhibitory response to threat. Such a mechanism would ensure the preservation of adaptive behavior, during situations normally associated with overwhelming and potentially disorganizing anxiety. In DPD, such a response would become chronic and dysfunctional. Depersonalization remains a condition for which no definitive treatment exists, and for which conventional medications, such as antidepressants or antipsychotics, have been found to be of little value. Fortunately, a few promising lines of pharmacological treatment have emerged in recent years, although more rigorous studies are needed. For example, a number of studies suggest that opioid receptor antagonists such as naltrexone and naloxone are useful in at least a subgroup of patients. In spite of initial expectations, the use of lamotrigine as a sole medication has not been found useful. However, open-label trials suggest that its use as an add-on treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is beneficial in a substantial number of patients. Similarly, the use of clonazepam, particularly in conjunction with SSRI antidepressants, appears to be beneficial in patients with high levels of background anxiety. In line with the stress-related model of depersonalization, those neurotransmitter systems of relevance to depersonalization are known to play important inhibitory roles in the regulation of the stress response. © 2008 Future Drugs Ltd.

N2  - Schizophrenia represents a pervasive deficit in brain function, leading to hallucinations and delusions, social withdrawal and a decline in cognitive performance. As the underlying genetic and neuronal abnormalities in schizophrenia are largely unknown, it is challenging to measure the severity of its symptoms objectively, or to design and evaluate psychotherapeutic interventions. Recent advances in neurophysiological techniques provide new opportunities to measure abnormal brain functions in patients with schizophrenia and to compare these with drug-induced alterations. Moreover, many of these neurophysiological processes are phylogenetically conserved and can be modelled in preclinical studies, offering unique opportunities for use as translational biomarkers in schizophrenia drug discovery.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - After a hiatus of nearly 40 years, psychedelic drugs (or hallucinogens) are being increasingly researched as possible adjuncts to psychotherapy for treatment-resistant anxiety disorders and addictions. This research offers an exciting future for this class of drugs whose image has been tarnished by recreational use since the 1960s.Through cautious and evidence-based studies, these medications could be finding their way back to where they began their lives: as valid and effective tools for clinical medicine and neuroscientific research.

N2  - Until very recently, comparatively few scientists were studying hallucinogenic drugs. Nevertheless, selective antagonists are available for relevant serotonergic receptors, the majority of which have now been cloned, allowing for reasonably thorough pharmacological investigation. Animal models sensitive to the behavioral effects of the hallucinogens have been established and exploited. Sophisticated genetic techniques have enabled the development of mutant mice, which have proven useful in the study of hallucinogens. The capacity to study post-receptor signaling events has lead to the proposal of a plausible mechanism of action for these compounds. The tools currently available to study the hallucinogens are thus more plentiful and scientifically advanced than were those accessible to earlier researchers studying the opioids, benzodiazepines, cholinergics, or other centrally active compounds. The behavioral pharmacology of phenethylamine, tryptamine, and ergoline hallucinogens are described in this review, paying particular attention to important structure activity relationships which have emerged, receptors involved in their various actions, effects on conditioned and unconditioned behaviors, and in some cases, human psychopharmacology. As clinical interest in the therapeutic potential of these compounds is once again beginning to emerge, it is important to recognize the wealth of data derived from controlled preclinical studies on these compounds. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Antagonism of phencyclidine-induced stimulus control in the rat by other psychoactive drugs
A1  - Winter J.C. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - It has been observed that agents with agonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors prevent neurotoxicity induced by the non-competitive NMDA antagonist, dizocilpine (MK-801). Subsequent behavioral studies reported complete antagonism by LSD and DOM of the stimulus effects of the related NMDA antagonist, phencyclidine [PCP]. The present study sought to extend those observations to include other psychoactive drugs. Male F-344 rats were trained in a 2-lever, fixed-ratio 10, food-reinforced task with PCP (3.0 mg/kg; IP; 30 min pretreatment) as a discriminative stimulus. Tests of generalization were then conducted using the training dose of PCP in combination with a range of doses of DOM, LSD, d-amphetamine, MDMA, psilocybin, buspirone, and GHB. All of the drugs tested in combination with PCP produced a statistically significant diminution of PCP-appropriate responding but for none was antagonism complete. These data, obtained using a stimulus control model of the hallucinogenic effects of PCP, fail to support the hypothesis that LSD and DOM completely antagonize stimulus control by PCP. Instead, the data suggest complex interactions between PCP-induced stimulus control and a variety of psychoactive drugs including GHB, an agent with no known affinity for serotonergic receptors. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Hallucinogen-like effects of N,N-dipropyltryptamine (DPT): Possible mediation by serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in rodents

N2  - N,N-dipropyltryptamine (DPT) is a synthetic tryptamine hallucinogen which has been used psychotherapeutically in humans, but has been studied preclinically only rarely. In the present studies, DPT was tested in a drug-elicited head-twitch assay in mice, and in rats trained to discriminate lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), N,N-dimethyl-4-phosphoryloxytryptamine (psilocybin), or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). A separate group of rats was also trained to recognize DPT itself as a discriminative stimulus, and in all cases, the behavioral effects of DPT were challenged with the selective serotonin (5-HT)2A antagonist M100907, the 5-HT1A selective antagonist WAY-100635, or their combination. In the head-twitch assay, DPT elicited dose-dependent effects, producing a biphasic dose-effect curve. WAY-100635 produced a parallel rightward shift in the dose-effect curve for head twitches, indicative of surmountable antagonism, but the antagonist effects of M100907 were functionally insurmountable. DPT produced partial to full substitution when tested in rats trained to discriminate LSD, psilocybin or MDMA, and served as a discriminative stimulus. In all cases, the antagonist effects of M100907 were more profound than were those of WAY-100635. DPT is thus active in two rodent models relevant to 5-HT2 agonist activity. The effectiveness with which M100907 antagonizes the behavioral actions of this compound strongly suggest that the 5-HT2A receptor is an important site of action for DPT, but the modulatory actions of WAY-100635 also imply a 5-HT1A-mediated component to the actions of this compound. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Hallucinogens, including mescaline, psilocybin, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), profoundly affect perception, cognition, and mood. All known drugs of this class are 5-HT2A receptor (2AR) agonists, yet closely related 2AR agonists such as lisuride lack comparable psychoactive properties. Why only certain 2AR agonists are hallucinogens and which neural circuits mediate their effects are poorly understood. By genetically expressing 2AR only in cortex, we show that 2AR-regulated pathways on cortical neurons are sufficient to mediate the signaling pattern and behavioral response to hallucinogens. Hallucinogenic and nonhallucinogenic 2AR agonists both regulate signaling in the same 2AR-expressing cortical neurons. However, the signaling and behavioral responses to the hallucinogens are distinct. While lisuride and LSD both act at 2AR expressed by cortex neurons to regulate phospholipase C, LSD responses also involve pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins and Src. These studies identify the long-elusive neural and signaling mechanisms responsible for the unique effects of hallucinogens. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - In summary, the wild mushroom is widely distributed in the green part of Jordan, some of it are extremely toxic and others are edible. Serious efforts are needed to identify both types and to isolate the major chemical constituents of the toxic mushroom in Jordan. It is difficult to suggest a universal detoxification methods or antidotes without knowing exactly the nature of mushroom toxicants. Furthermore, extremely useful pharmacological constituents may be obtained from the wild mushroom of Jordan. © 2007 DAR Publishers/ University of Jordan. All Rights Reserved.

N2  - A modified oligonucleotide-based two-channel DNA microarray was developed for characterization of temporal expression profiles of select Choristoneura fumiferana nucleopolyhedrovirus (CfMNPV) ORFs including its 7 unique ORFs. The microarray chip contained oligonucleotide probes for 23 CfMNPV ORFs and their complements as well as five host genes. Total RNA was isolated at different times post infection from Cf203 insect cells infected with CfMNPV. The cDNA was synthesized, fluorescent labelled with Cy3, and co-hybridized to the microarray chips along with Cy5-labelled viral genomic DNA, which served as equimolar reference standards for each probe. Transcription of the 7 CfMNPV unique ORFs was detected using DNA microarray analysis and their temporal expression profiles suggest that they are functional genes. The expression levels of three host genes varied throughout virus infection and therefore were unsuitable for normalization between microarrays. The DNA microarray results were compared to quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Transcription of the non-coding (antisense) strands of some of the CfMNPV select genes including the polyhedrin gene, was also detected by array analysis and confirmed by qRT-PCR. The polyhedrin antisense transcript, based on long-range RT-PCR analysis, appeared to be a read-through product of an adjacent ORF in the same orientation as the antisense transcript. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The present investigation evaluated the associations between lifetime psychedelic use, abuse, and dependence and panic attacks. The study consisted of a representative epidemiological sample from a state wide survey of the Colorado general adult population (n = 4745; 52% female). Consistent with prediction, after controlling for theoretically relevant variables, psychedelic abuse and dependence, but not use, were significantly related to an increased lifetime risk of panic attacks. The results are discussed in terms of better understanding the role of psychedelic use in relation to the occurrence of panic attacks. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Aims: To describe and assess trends in the use of hallucinogens and other adjunct drugs over a 5-year period. Design: Repeated-measures cross-sectional survey. Setting and Participants: Annual magazine-based survey targeting people who use drugs in dance contexts. Measurements: Lifetime use prevalence (ever used); age of first use; current use prevalence (any use within the last month), and extent of use within the last month (number of days used) for LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, GHB and nitrates. Findings: Prevalence increases for psilocybin, ketamine, GHB and nitrates use have been detected, with a sharp recent rise in current psilocybin use in 2002-2003 contrasting with more gradual and comprehensive evidence of increased ketamine use throughout the period 1999-2003. The declining prevalence of LSD use in general population surveys is replicated in this sentinel population study. Conclusions: The rise in prevalence of hallucinogen and other adjunct drugs identified among dance drug users may be mirrored by wider prevalence increases among young people with a consequent need to study these trends carefully and to develop effective interventions, where required.

T1  - 5-HT1A receptors and memory
A1  - Meneses A.
A1  - Perez-Garcia G. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - The study of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) systems has benefited from the identification, classification and cloning of multiple 5-HT receptors (5-HT1-5-HT7). Increasing evidence suggests that 5-HT pathways, reuptake site/transporter complex and 5-HT receptors represent a strategic distribution for learning and memory. A key question still remaining is whether 5-HT markers (e.g., receptors) are directly or indirectly contributing to the physiological and pharmacological basis of memory and its pathogenesis or, rather, if they represent protective or adaptable mechanisms (at least in initial stages). In the current paper, the major aim is to revise recent advances regarding mammalian 5-HT1A receptors in light of their physiological, pathophysiological and therapeutic implications in memory. An attempt is made to identify and discuss sources of discrepancies by employing an analytic approach to examine the nature and degree of difficulty of behavioral tasks used, as well as implicating other factors (for example, brain areas, training time or duration, and drug administration) which might offer new insights into the understanding and interpretation of these data. In this context, 8-OH-DPAT deserves special attention since for many years it has been the more selective 5-HT drug and, hence, more frequently used. As 5-HT1A receptors are key components of serotonergic signaling, investigation of their memory mechanisms and action sites and the conditions under which they might operate, could yield valuable insights. Moreover, selective drugs with agonists, neutral antagonists or inverse agonist properties for 5-HT1A (and 5-HT7) receptors may constitute a new therapeutic opportunity for learning and memory disorders. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Long term marijuana users seeking medical cannabis in California (2001-2007): Demographics, social characteristics, patterns of cannabis and other drug use of 4117 applicants

N2  - Background: Cannabis (marijuana) had been used for medicinal purposes for millennia. Cannabinoid agonists are now attracting growing interest and there is also evidence that botanical cannabis is being used as self-medication for stress and anxiety as well as adjunctive therapy by the seriously ill and by patients with terminal illnesses. California became the first state to authorize medicinal use of cannabis in 1996, and it was recently estimated that between 250,000 and 350,000 Californians may now possess the physician's recommendation required to use it medically. More limited medical use has also been approved in 12 additional states and new initiatives are being considered in others. Despite that evidence of increasing public acceptance of "medical" use, a definitional problem remains and all use for any purpose is still prohibited by federal law. Results: California's 1996 initiative allowed cannabis to be recommended, not only for serious illnesses, but also "for any other illness for which marijuana provides relief," thus maximally broadening the range of allowable indications. In effect, the range of conditions now being treated with federally illegal cannabis, the modes in which it is being used, and the demographics of the population using it became potentially discoverable through the required screening of applicants. This report examines the demographic profiles and other selected characteristics of 4117 California marijuana users (62% from the Greater Bay Area) who applied for medical recommendations between late 2001 and mid 2007. Conclusion: This study yielded a somewhat unexpected profile of a hitherto hidden population of users of America's most popular illegal drug. It also raises questions about some of the basic assumptions held by both proponents and opponents of current policy. © 2007 O'Connell and Bou-Matar; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

T1  - The effects of the preferential 5-HT2A agonist psilocybin on prepulse inhibition of startle in healthy human volunteers depend on interstimulus interval

N2  - Schizophrenia patients exhibit impairments in prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response. Hallucinogenic 5-HT2A receptor agonists are used for animal models of schizophrenia because they mimic some symptoms of schizophrenia in humans and induce PPI deficits in animals. Nevertheless, one report indicates that the 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin increases PPI in healthy humans. Hence, we investigated these inconsistent results by assessing the dose-dependent effects of psilocybin on PPI in healthy humans. Sixteen subjects each received placebo or 115, 215, and 315 mug/kg of psilocybin at 4-week intervals in a randomized and counterbalanced order. PPI at 30-, 60-, 120-, 240-, and 2000-ms interstimulus intervals (ISIs) was measured 90 and 165 min after drug intake, coinciding with the peak and post-peak effects of psilocybin. The effects of psilocybin on psychopathological core dimensions and sustained attention were assessed by the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D-ASC) and the Frankfurt Attention Inventory (FAIR). Psilocybin dose-dependently reduced PPI at short (30 ms), had no effect at medium (60 ms), and increased PPI at long (120-2000 ms) ISIs, without affecting startle reactivity or habituation. Psilocybin dose-dependently impaired sustained attention and increased all 5D-ASC scores with exception of Auditory Alterations. Moreover, psilocybin-induced impairments in sustained attention performance were positively correlated with reduced PPI at the 30 ms ISI and not with the concomitant increases in PPI observed at long ISIs. These results confirm the psilocybin-induced increase in PPI at long ISIs and reveal that psilocybin also produces a decrease in PPI at short ISIs that is correlated with impaired attention and consistent with deficient PPI in schizophrenia. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

T1  - Is there a case for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the UK?
A1  - Sessa B. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Much has been written in scientific and popular literature in recent years about the dangers surrounding the recreational use of the drug MDMA/ecstasy. What is little known and understood however is the history of the apparently safe and effective use of MDMA as a therapeutic tool for psychotherapy. In this paper the author explores this history and describes the recent re-emergence of scientific interest in MDMA and other psychedelic drugs. There are currently several new double-blind randomised controlled trials underway re-visiting the subject. By acknowledging the limitations of this new research and emphasising the importance of exercising appropriate but realistic caution, the author asks that the medical profession consider a dispassionate and open-minded debate to examine whether MDMA might have a legitimate place as an adjunct to psychotherapy in modern psychiatric practice. © 2007 British Association for Psychopharmacology.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - The incidence of fungal poisoning varies a lot in a global perspective and it is related to local habits, economic factors and lifestyle. Among thousands of mushroom species fewer than a hundred are toxic. Most fungal toxins cause mild or moderate poisoning. It is, however, the ingestion of a few species of extremely poisonous fungi that define the medical dimension of the problem. Mushroom poisoning is mostly accidental and the result of a mix-up between edible and toxic fungi, but intentional ingestion of psychotropic ('magic') mushrooms is also a problem. The most dreaded poisonings are those caused by cytotoxic agents, e.g. amatoxins in death cap and destroying angel (severe gastroenteritis and liver damage) or orellanine in Cortinarius spp. (kidney damage). Dramatic, but rarely lethal, effects are caused by fungi-holding neurotoxins like muscarine (Clitocybe and Inocybe spp.), psilocybin (Psilocybe and Panaeolus spp. - 'magic' mushrooms), isoxazoles (fly agaric and panther cap) and gyromitrin (false morels). Many poisonous species cause gastroenteritis only. Treatment includes gastrointestinal decontamination and general symptomatic and supportive care. Specific antidotes exist for fungi containing muscarine, gyromitrin and amatoxins. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Rationale: Binocular rivalry occurs when different images are simultaneously presented to each eye. During continual viewing of this stimulus, the observer will experience repeated switches between visual awareness of the two images. Previous studies have suggested that a slow rate of perceptual switching may be associated with clinical and drug-induced psychosis. Objectives: The objective of the study was to explore the proposed relationship between binocular rivalry switch rate and subjective changes in psychological state associated with 5-HT2A receptor activation. Materials and methods: This study used psilocybin, the hallucinogen found naturally in Psilocybe mushrooms that had previously been found to induce psychosis-like symptoms via the 5-HT2A receptor. The effects of psilocybin (215 mug/kg) were considered alone and after pretreatment with the selective 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (50 mg) in ten healthy human subjects. Results: Psilocybin significantly reduced the rate of binocular rivalry switching and increased the proportion of transitional/mixed percept experience. Pretreatment with ketanserin blocked the majority of psilocybin's "positive" psychosis-like hallucinogenic symptoms. However, ketanserin had no influence on either the psilocybin-induced slowing of binocular rivalry or the drug's "negative-type symptoms" associated with reduced arousal and vigilance. Conclusions: Together, these findings link changes in binocular rivalry switching rate to subjective levels of arousal and attention. In addition, it suggests that psilocybin's effect on binocular rivalry is unlikely to be mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

T1  - Multipole electrostatic potential derived atomic charges in NDDO-methods with spd-basis sets

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - The recently introduced multipole approach for computing the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) within the semiempirical neglect of diatomic differential overlap (NDDO) framework [Horn AHC, Lin Jr-H., Clark T (2005) Theor Chem Acc 114:159-168] has been used to obtain atomic charges of nearly ab initio quality by scaling the semiempirical MEP. The parameterization set comprised a total of 797 compounds and included not only the newly parameterized AM1* elements Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ti, Zr, and Mo but also the standard AM1 elements H, C, N, O and F. For comparison, the ZDO-approximated MEP was also calculated analytically in the spd -basis. For the AM1*-optimized structures, single-point calculations at the B3LYP, HF and MP2 levels with the 6-31G(d) and LanL2DZP basis sets were performed to obtain the MEP. The regression analysis of all 12 combinations of semiempirical and ab initio MEP data yielded correlation coefficients of at least 0.99 in all cases. Scaling the analytical and multipole-derived semiempirical MEP by the regression coefficients yielded mean unsigned errors below 2.6 and 1.9 kcal mol-1, respectively. Subsequently, for 22 drug molecules from the World Drug Index, atomic charges were computed according to the RESP procedure using XX/6-31G(d) (XX=B3LYP, HF, MP2) and scaled AM1* multipole MEP; the correlation coefficients obtained are 0.83, 0.85 and 0.83, respectively. Figure: Schematic representation of the atomic charge generation: The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) is calculated using the AM1* Hamiltonian; then the semiempirical MEP is scaled to DFT or ab initio level, and atomic charges are generated subsequently by the restraint electrostatic potential (RESP) fit method. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

T1  - From prediction error to psychosis: Ketamine as a pharmacological model of delusions

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Recent cognitive neuropsychiatric modeLs of psychosis emphasize the roLe of attentionaL disturbances and inappropriate incentive Learning in the deveLopment of deLusions. These modeLs highLight a pre-psychotic period in which the patient experiences perceptuaL and attentionaL disruptions. IrreLevant detaiLs and numerous associations between stimuLi, thoughts and percepts are imbued with inappropriate significance and the attempt to rationaLize and account for these bizarre experiences resuLts in the formation of deLusions. The present paper discusses deLusion formation in terms of basic associative Learning processes. Such processes are driven by prediction error signaLs. Prediction error refers to mismatches between an organism's expectation in a given environment and what actuaLLy happens and it is signaLLed by both dopaminergic and gLutamatergic mechanisms. Disruption of these neurobioLogicaL systems may underLie deLusion formation. We review simiLarities between acute psychosis and the psychotic state induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist drug ketamine, which impacts upon both dopaminergic and gLutamatergic function. We concLude by suggesting that ketamine may provide an appropriate modeL to investigate the formative stages of symptom evoLution in schizophrenia, and thereby provide a window into the earLiest and otherwise inaccessibLe aspects of the disease process. © 2007 British Association for Psychopharmacology.

N2  - Patients with schizophrenia exhibit diminished prepuLse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startLe reflex and deficits in the attentionaL moduLation of PPI. PharmacoLogicaL chaLLenges with haLLucinogens are used as modeLs for psychosis in both humans and animaLs. RemarkabLy, in contrast to the findings in schizophrenic patients and in animaL haLLucinogen modeLs of psychosis, previous studies with heaLthy voLunteers demonstrated increased LeveLs of PPI after administration of Low to moderate doses of either the antigLutamatergic haLLucinogen ketamine or the serotonergic haLLucinogen psiLocybin. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of moderate and high doses of the serotonergic haLLucinogen N,N-dimethyLtryptamine (DMT) and the N-methyL-D-aspartate antagonist S-ketamine on PPI and its attentionaL moduLation in humans. Fifteen heaLthy voLunteers were incLuded in a doubLe-bLind cross-over study with two doses of DMT and S-ketamine. Effects on PPI and its attentionaL moduLation were investigated. Nine subjects compLeted both experimentaL days with the two doses of both drugs. S-ketamine increased PPI in both dosages, whereas DMT had no significant effects on PPI. S-ketamine decreased and DMT tended to decrease startLe magnitude. There were no significant effects of either drug on the attentionaL moduLation of PPI. In human experimentaL haLLucinogen psychoses, and even with high, cLearLy psychotogenic doses of DMT or S-ketamine, heaLthy subjects faiLed to exhibit the predicted attenuation of PPI. In contrast, PPI was augmented and the startLe magnitude was decreased after S-ketamine. These data point to important differences between human haLLucinogen modeLs and both animaL haLLucinogen modeLs of psychosis and naturally occurring schizophrenia. © 2007 British Association for Psychopharmacology.

T1  - Somatically based psychoses and the problem of symptomatic Schizophrenia
A1  - Gross G.
A1  - Huber G. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - The question, if there are "symptomatic schizophrenias", caused and not only released by brain diseases, has been discussed since the 20s of the last century. Kurt SCHNEIDER (KS), whose work abounds with evidences of a rich clinical experience, dealt with this issue in the 5th chapter of the "Clinical Psychopathology" [102: pp 37-42]. He prefers for psychoses of this type, denoted by other authors as "exogenous" or "organic", the term "somatically based psychoses" ("korperlich begrundbare Psychosen") as clinically indispensable, but "basically ambiguous term". Also in DSM-IV the term "organic" is no longer used. This critical review proceeds from the observations, that nearly all schizophrenic symptoms and syndromes, including the first and second rank symptoms of KS, occur also in somatically founded psychoses and that almost all various brain diseases can occasionally show schizophrenic symptoms and syndromes, psychopathologically not distinguishable from idiopathic schizophrenias. Unlike to KS's former opinion doubtless occur cases, where the question "Symptom" or "Auslosung" remains not unanswerable, particularly in patients without schizophrenias in the first and second degree relatives. The issue of our study, the question whether symptomatic schizophrenias exist, phenomenologically identical with endogenous ones, also in the last decades has been answered differently, thus affirmative by CONRAD, WEITBRECHT, WALTER-BUEL and HUBER, negative e. g. by WYRSCH and M. BLEULER, who hold on the always different quality, the "numinous singularity" and unmistakable specificity of the "schizophrenic". That symptomatic schizophrenias exist, caused by brain - and brain involving - diseases, has been proved by numerous observations, as shown in our study. Primary and secondary brain diseases, underlying the symptomatic schizophrenia, are presented. Symptomatic schizophrenias, persisting days, weeks, months and sometimes for years, can be seen on use or misuse of medicaments and drugs, in encephalitis, in brain tumours, especially those of the brain stem, diencephalon and temporal and orbital lobes, in degenerative and extrapyramidal brain diseases, epilepsy, especially temporal lobe epilepsy. Besides acute and reversible occur also recurrent and chronic courses of symptomatic schizophrenias. We mention especially the observations in chronic abuse of amphetamine derivatives, psychoses provoked by psychodysleptics, f.i. the hallucinogenes mescaline, cannabis, LSD-25, psilocybin and phencyclidine (PCP), that were used already in the 20s of the last century, to study psychotic experiences in so-called model psychoses; further the sporadic, atypical, virus caused, spontaneous encephalitis, revealing in initial stages purely schizophrenic psychosyndromes and recognizable as "exogenous" only in later course periods. Life threatening, so-called pernicious catatonic schizophrenias are found e. g. on the basis of infectious brain diseases and carbon monoxide intoxication, sometimes only diagnosable by autopsy. The aura prolongata, characterized by psychopathological phenomena corresponding to quite a number of basic symptoms of schizophrenias, can be a model for the schizophrenia research. According to the findings of WIESER, ascertained with stereoelectroencephalographic deep recordings, an involvement of mesobasal parts of the temporal lobe, affiliated to the limbic system, with focal points in the region of amygdala and hippocampus, is expressed in such phenomena. The list of the aura phenomena, described by this author, can be read as a catalogue of schizophrenic basic symptoms, defined in the Bonn instrument BSABS, with all transitions to schizophrenic first and second rank symptoms. According to KOELLA and TRIMBLE schizophrenia and temporal lobe epilepsy in the acute phases and interictal psychoses exhibit often a considerable overlap in their symptomatological profile. The authors assume an overlap also in their pathogenesis and a common pathology involving structures within the limbic system. They emphasize the role of somatic structures and especially of the limbic part of the brain for the pathogenesis of psychopathological disorders and expect as GROSS and HUBER, that the myth of mental illness will some day disappear. In agreement with these authors, we request that the false dichotomy between psychiatric and neurological illnesses needs to be overcome. In the second half of the last century the evolution of the limbic system concept take place with the accumulation of data, regarding the relationships of the limbic system to behaviour and in connection with the research, directed to psychopathological-somatic correlations, since the 50s going hand in hand with the gradual development of the basic symptom concept and of the long-term course and early recognition research. The results of these investigations with the topical predilection, the "neuroradiological basal ganglia syndrome" and the MRI changes of sections of the limbic system, were indications, that for schizophrenias disturbances in limbic key structures, which can explain basic symptoms and first rank phenomena, arising from distinct cognitive basic disorders, are meaningful. As well a renaissance of neuropsychiatry, as a comprehensive education in psychopathology, including clinical experience with organic psychosyndromes, is advocated. The discussed question can at present be answered without doubt: There exist symptomatic schizophrenias, caused by morphological and/or functional brain changes. This has been proved by the findings of the last decades and here also by the research in genetics and molecular biology with the description of hereditary diseases, presenting as schizophrenic psychoses [97]. Also in the last years observations of symptomatic schizophrenias were published, e. g. in arpha-mannosidosis, Epstein-Barr-virus encephalitis and velocardiofacial syndrome. The history of exogenous reaction types has shown that somatically founded schizophrenic psychoses can occur in nearly all known brain diseases. Thus, also the schizophrenic syndrome has to be regarded as an organic psychosyndrome, pointing to a pathological cerebral functional change. The synopsis of the findings leads to a revision of the doctrine of the "numinous singularity" and radical heterogeneity of schizophrenia against already known brain diseases. © Universita tsverlag Ulm GmbH 2007.

N2  - Hallucinogenic psilocybin is known to alter the subjective experience of time. However, there is no study that systematically investigated objective measures of time perception under psilocybin. Therefore, we studied dose-dependent effects of the serotonin (5-HT)2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine) on temporal processing, employing tasks of temporal reproduction, sensorimotor synchronization and tapping tempo. To control for cognitive and subjective changes, we assessed spatial working memory and conscious experience. Twelve healthy human volunteers were tested under placebo, medium (115mug/kg), and high (250mug/kg) dose conditions, in a double-blind experimental design. Psilocybin was found to significantly impair subjects' ability to (1) reproduce interval durations longer than 2.5 sec, (2) to synchronize to inter-beat intervals longer than 2 sec and (3) caused subjects to be slower in their preferred tapping rate. These objective effects on timing performance were accompanied by working-memory deficits and subjective changes in conscious state, namely increased reports of 'depersonalization' and 'derealization' phenomena including disturbances in subjective 'time sense.' Our study is the first to systematically assess the impact of psilocybin on timing performance on standardized measures of temporal processing. Results indicate that the serotonin system is selectively involved in duration processing of intervals longer than 2 to 3 seconds and in the voluntary control of the speed of movement. We speculate that psilocybin's selective disruption of longer intervals is likely to be a product of interactions with cognitive dimensions of temporal processing -presumably via 5-HT2A receptor stimulation. © 2007 British Association for Psychopharmacology.

A1  - Shamblen S.R.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - There is an absence of systematic, comparative research examining the negative consequences that are experienced as a result of using specific substances. Further, techniques typically used for needs assessment (i.e., prevalence proportions) do not take into account the probability of experiencing a negative consequence as a result of using specific substances. An approximated severity index is proposed that: a) takes into account the probability of experiencing negative consequences as a result of using specific substances; and b) is comparable across substances. Data from the NSDUH and the ADSS are used to demonstrate these techniques. The findings suggest that substances typically considered priorities based on prevalence proportions are not the same substances that have a high probability of causing negative consequences. The policy implications of these findings are discussed. © 2007, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.

N2  - Introduction: The ability to read facial expressions is essential for normal human social interaction. The aim of the present study was to conduct the first investigation of facial expression recognition performance in recreational cocaine users. Materials and methods: Three groups, comprised of 21 cocaine naive participants (CN), 30 occasional cocaine (OC), and 48 regular recreational cocaine (RC) users, were compared. An emotional facial expression (EFE) task consisting of a male and female face expressing six basic emotions (happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust) was administered. Mean percent accuracy and latencies for correct responses across eight presentations of each basic emotion were derived. Participants were also assessed with the "Eyes task" to investigate their ability to recognize more complex emotional states and the Symptom CheckList-90-Revised to measure psychopathology. Results: There were no group differences in psychopathology or "eyes task" performance, but the RC group, who otherwise had similar illicit substance use histories to the OC group, exhibited impaired fear recognition accuracy compared to the OC and CN groups. The RC group also correctly identified anger, fear, happiness, and surprise, more slowly than CN, but not OC participants. The OC group was slower than CN when correctly identifying disgust. The selective deficit in fear recognition accuracy manifested by the RC group cannot be explained by the subacute effects of cocaine, or ecstasy, because recent and less recent users of these drugs within this group were similarly impaired. Possible parallels between RC users and psychopaths with respect to impaired fear recognition, amygdala dysfunction, and etiology are discussed. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - The purpose of the present paper was to explore the concept and experience of God in relation to recovery from drug addiction from a scientific perspective. Examination of a diverse literature was undertaken, including five key threads: the universality of the experience of God; the induction of spiritual experiences of God through hallucinogenic drugs; the nature of drug addiction from an evolutionary neurobiological perspective; the 12 Step movement as the prototype for the place of God in recovery from drug addiction; and identified ingredients for successful recovery from addiction. The diverse threads of literature examined can be integrated around the concept of higher power as an important factor in recovery from drug addiction. Higher power can be manifested in individuals in diverse ways: religious, ethnic, spiritual including the use of entheogens, as well as cognitive behavioural development, but a common final pathway for all is the strengthening of executive functions (the brain's 'higher power'). Practical implications for assisting people with drug addiction to achieve recovery through their own experience of God/development of higher power are outlined.

N2  - Objectives: To examine patterns and predictors of medication compliance, diversion, and misuse in a sample of adults with prescriptions for the stimulant medication methylphenidate (MPH). Methods: Sixty-six adults currently prescribed MPH (53% male) completed structured interviews and provided details regarding their medication and other substance use histories. Results: On average, participants reported using their medication as prescribed on 14.5 (SD 11.7) of the past 30 days; 44% admitted to diverting it and 29% admitted to inappropriate use. While analyses revealed that medication misuse, diversion, and level of compliance were interrelated and all associated with concurrent illicit substance use, each also had other distinct associations. Specifically, MPH misuse was associated with the use of illicit stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine, diversion with age and age of MPH prescription, and compliance with participation in an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) support group. Regression analyses revealed that misuse and poor compliance were both best predicted by concurrent illicit substance use, while the model that best predicted diversion included age of first MPH prescription (younger) and MPH misuse. Conclusions: Poor medication compliance, diversion, and misuse are relatively common and interrelated among adult MPH users. MPH prescriptions should be monitored closely in individuals with histories of illicit substance use. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Two young men, 25 and 32 years old, presented with severe automutilation by knife wounds after consumption of hallucinogenic mushrooms. The first patient had also used cocaine, cannabis and alcohol, while the second patient had only used the hallucinogenic mushrooms. Both patients were treated symptomatically and survived despite their severe stab wounds. Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are used as mind-altering drugs. These drugs may sometimes induce 'bad trips', a psychotic reaction accompanied by fear, panic, and dangerous behaviour, especially when used in combination with other drugs and alcohol or by psychiatrically unstable patients. During a bad trip, patients may hurt themselves. Because the duration of the psychotic and sympathicomimetic effects of psilocybin after ingestion of mushrooms is short (up to 6 h), and since psilocin itself causes no permanent organ toxicity, the treatment of psilocybin intoxication is only symptomatic. The diagnosis of psilocybin intoxication is hampered by the lack of routinely available, rapid and sensitive, analytical methods for the quantification of psilocybin and its active metabolite psilocin.

T1  - Psilocybin-induced stimulus control in the rat

N2  - Although psilocybin has been trained in the rat as a discriminative stimulus, little is known of the pharmacological receptors essential for stimulus control. In the present investigation rats were trained with psilocybin and tests were then conducted employing a series of other hallucinogens and presumed antagonists. An intermediate degree of antagonism of psilocybin was observed following treatment with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, M100907. In contrast, no significant antagonism was observed following treatment with the 5-HT1A/7 receptor antagonist, WAY-100635, or the DA D2 antagonist, remoxipride. Psilocybin generalized fully to DOM, LSD, psilocin, and, in the presence of WAY-100635, DMT while partial generalization was seen to 2C-T-7 and mescaline. LSD and MDMA partially generalized to psilocybin and these effects were completely blocked by M-100907; no generalization of PCP to psilocybin was seen. The present data suggest that psilocybin induces a compound stimulus in which activity at the 5-HT2A receptor plays a prominent but incomplete role. In addition, psilocybin differs from closely related hallucinogens such as 5-MeO-DMT in that agonism at 5-HT1A receptors appears to play no role in psilocybin-induced stimulus control. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Can mushrooms help save the world?
A1  - Stamets P. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Paul Stamets, founder and director of Fungi Perfecti, LLC., and director of the Fungi Perfecti Research Laboratories (www.fungi.com), has been a mycologist and mushroom enthusiast for more than 30 years. A pioneer in the cultivation of edible and medicinal mushrooms, he is credited with the discovery of four new mushroom species. Stamets is the author of five books on mushroom cultivation, use, and identification, including MycoMedicinals: An Informational Treatise on Mushrooms; Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World; Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms; Mushroom Cultivator; Psilocybe Mushrooms & Their Allies; and his most recent one Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World. Stamets holds a vision of a deeply interconnected world environment and firmly believes that a greater knowledge of fungi can solve many of the world's pollution problems as well as some of the world's health problems. He has a strong interest in saving the old growth forests of the Pacific Northwest where many ancient species of mushrooms can be found. A dedicated explorer with a passion to preserve, protect, and clone as many ancestral strains of mushrooms as possible, he was the 1998 recipient of the Collective Heritage Institute's Bioneers Award and the 1999 recipient of the Founder of a New Northwest Award from the Pacific Rim Association of Resource Conservation and Development Councils. EXPLORE interviewed Stamets at his home and mushroom farms near Seattle, Washington, in the summer of 2005. © 2006 by Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Evidence for a hallucinogen dependence syndrome developing soon after onset of hallucinogen use during adolescence

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - This study uses latent class methods and multiple regression to shed light on hypothesized hallucinogen dependence syndromes experienced by young people who have recently initiated hallucinogen use. It explores possible variation in risk. The study sample, identified within public-use data files of the 1999 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA), consists of 1186 recent-onset hallucinogen users, defined as having initiated hallucinogen use within 24 months of assessment (median elapsed time since onset of use ~12 to 13 months). The recent-onset users in this sample were age 12 to 21 at the time of assessment and were between the ages of 10 and 21 at the time of their first hallucinogen use. The NHSDA included items to assess seven clinical features often associated with hallucinogen dependence, which were used in latent class modelling. Latent class analysis, in conjunction with prior theory, supports a three-class solution, with 2% of recent-onset users in a class that resembles a hallucinogen dependence syndrome, whereas 88% expressed few or no clinical features of dependence. The remaining 10% may reflect users who are at risk for dependence or in an early stage of dependence. Results from latent class regressions indicate that susceptibility to rapid transition from first hallucinogen use to onset of this hallucinogen dependence syndrome might be influenced by hallucinogenic compounds taken (for example, estimated relative risk, RR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.6, 7.6 for users of MDMA versus users of LSD). Excess risk of rapid transition did not appear to depend upon age, sex, or race/ethnicity. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - The adverse effects of hallucinogens from intramural perspective
A1  - Frecska E.
A1  - Luna L.E. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Very recently, after a long-lasting, worldwide moratorium on research of hallucinogenic agents, a good number of advanced countries have been revising their position, and start to approve testing the physiological and therapeutic effects of hallucinogens in human subjects. The purpose of this article is to review safety information available in the literature on hallucinogen use, and sort out those data from the reported complications of their abuse. Because of prohibitory regulations of the last 35 years, there are difficulties in achieving this kind of evaluation. Our approach has to be broad, and at times retrospective, in contrast to the well-controlled, focused, prospective design of the premarketing trials of legal drugs. The article summarizes the analyses in anticipation of supportive regulatory changes for the use of hallucinogens in well controlled studies and strictly supervised clinical trials. Keywords: adverse effects, ayahuasca, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, hallucinogenic agents, ibogaine, lysergic acid diethylamide, N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, psilocybin, therapeutic use.

T1  - The internet as a source of drugs of abuse

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - The Internet is a vital medium for communication, entertainment, and commerce, with more than 1 billion individuals connected worldwide. In addition to the many positive functions served by the Internet, it also has been used to facilitate the illicit sale of controlled substances. No-prescription websites (NPWs) offer - and then actually sell - controlled substances over the Internet without a valid prescription. NPW monitoring studies have focused primarily on the availability of prescription opioid medications, although many other drugs of abuse also are available online. Research indicates that these NPW sites are prevalent. Google or Yahoo searches simply using the term "Vicodin" return 40% to 50% NPWs in the top 100 sites. Thus, NPWs represent an important development in the sale of illicit drugs because of the ease with which controlled substances can be sold with relative anonymity. The emergence of NPWs requires new law enforcement and public health initiatives; continued monitoring efforts will determine whether effort to reduce the availability of NPWs are successful.

N2  - The group of hallucinogenic mushrooms (species of the genera Conocybe, Gymnopilus, Panaeolus, Pluteus, Psilocybe, and Stropharia) is psilocybin-containing mushrooms. These "magic", psychoactive fungi have the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin. Toxicity of these mushrooms is substantial because of the popularity of hallucinogens. Psilocybin and its active metabolite psilocin are similar to lysergic acid diethylamide. These hallucinogens affect the central nervous system rapidly (within 0.5-1 hour after ingestion), producing ataxia, hyperkinesis, and hallucinations. In this review article there are discussed about history of use of hallucinogenic mushrooms and epidemiology; pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, somatic effects and pharmacokinetics of psilocybin, the clinical effects of psilocybin and psilocin, signs and symptoms of ingestion of hallucinogenic mushrooms, treatment and prognosis.

N2  - Hallucinogenic mushrooms, also called "magic mushrooms", are becoming a more frequent cause of abuse, especially among young people, who use them experimentally for recreational purposes. In the autumn of 2004, several people were admitted to and observed in the Department of Clinical Toxicology in Krakow after they had used magic mushrooms to experience hallucinatory sensations. Three of them had visual hallucinations, and the fourth experienced both visual and auditory hallucinations followed by the exogenous psychosis after use of Psilocybe semilanceata. One person was hospitalised for several days while the others were observed in the emergency department. The main source of information for patients about hallucinogenic mushrooms was the internet. In the cases discussed the mushroom poisoning caused no organ damage and the symptoms disappeared in about 6 hours.

N2  - We report the case of a 25-year-old, hepatitis C-infected man, who presented with severe rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, and later developed posterior encephalopathy with cortical blindness after the ingestion of magic mushrooms. Conventional respiratory and cardiovascular support including mechanical ventilation, continuous veno-venous hemodialysis and corticosteroids led to improvement and the patient recovered completely over the following months. Magic mushrooms are becoming increasingly fashionable among drug users, as they are believed to be more harmless than other hallucinogenic designer drugs. So far, little is known about their possible severe side effects.

N2  - From 140 species of genus Psylocibe about 80 have hallucinogenic properties. This paper presents the morphology of these fungi and the mycological methods of their identification. According to information of users, the normal dose is 5-30 fresh wild fungi or about 0,5-2 gram of dried wild fungi tissue, but a select type of mycelium from a glass culture may have significantly higher contents of psilocybine. The effective time on the human brain is about 4-5 hours. The toxic dose of psilocybine is unknown, but genus Psylocibe may be mistaken with other, similar, very toxic fungi.

T1  - Values and beliefs of psychedelic drug users: A cross-cultural study
A1  - Lerner M.
A1  - Lyvers M. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Psychedelic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin are often claimed to be capable of inducing life-changing experiences described as mystical or transcendental, especially if high doses are taken. The present study examined possible enduring effects of such experiences by comparing users of psychedelic drugs (n = 88), users of nonpsychedelic illegal drugs (e.g., marijuana, amphetamines) (n = 29) and non illicit drug-using social drinkers (n = 66) on questionnaire measures of values, beliefs and emotional empathy. Samples were obtained from Israel (n = 110) and Australia (n = 73) in a cross-cultural comparison to see if values associated with psychedelic drug use transcended culture of origin. Psychedelic users scored significantly higher on mystical beliefs (e.g., oneness with God and the universe) and life values of spirituality and concern for others than the other groups, and lower on the value of financial prosperity, irrespective of culture of origin. Users of nonpsychedelic illegal drugs scored significantly lower on a measure of coping ability than both psychedelic users and non illicit drug users. Both groups of illegal drug users scored significantly higher on empathy than non illicit drug users. Results are discussed in the context of earlier findings from Pahnke (1966) and Doblin (1991) of the transformative effect of psychedelic experiences, although the possibility remains that present findings reflect predrug characteristics of those who chose to take psychedelic drugs rather than effects of the drugs themselves.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) has been known as an analytical technique since the late 1960s and early 1970s. To date, it has been successfully utilized for the detection of environmental pollutants, warfare agents, explosives, herbicides, pesticides, petroleum products as well as for the detection of prescription and illicit drugs. In this paper the authors describe the use of the IMS technology in cases of forensic interest in Salzburg, Austria. We report the use of the IMS methodology for the rapid analysis of hallucinogenic mushroom material as well as for the analysis of samples taken after an explosion. A new application of the IMS technology for the analysis of postmortem sweat samples for drugs is also presented. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - Patterns of simultaneous polysubstance use in drug using university students

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Simultaneous polysubstance use (SPU) is a common phenomenon, yet little is known about how various substances are used with one another. In the present study 149 drug-using university students completed structured interviews about their use of various substances. For each substance ever used, participants provided details about the type, order and amount of all substances co-administered during its most recent administration. Alcohol, tobacco and cannabis were frequently coadministered with each other and with all other substances. Chi-squared tests revealed that when alcohol was used in combination with any of cannabis, psilocybin, MDMA, cocaine, amphetamine, methylphenidate (ps < 0.01) or LSD (p < 0.05) its initial use preceded the administration of the other substance. Paired samples t-tests revealed that when alcohol was used with cocaine (p < 0.01) or methylphenidate (p < 0.05) it was ingested in greater quantities than when used in their absence. Patterns of cannabis use were not systematically related to other substances administered. Finally, using one-sample t-tests, tobacco use was demonstrated to be increased relative to 'sober' smoking rates when used with alcohol, cannabis, psilocybin, MDMA, cocaine, amphetamine (ps < 0.001), LSD (p < 0.01) or methylphenidate (p < 0.05). Results suggest that many substances are routinely used in a SPU context and that the pattern in which a substance is used may be related to other substances co-administered.

N2  - The hallucinogenic mushroom Inocybe aeruginascens contains several typical Psilocybe alkaloids including psilocybin. We have now elucidated the structure of a further indole derivative named aeruginascin as the quaternary ammonium compound N,N,N-trimethyl-4-phosphoryloxytryptamine. Aeruginascin is closely related to the frog skin toxin bufotenidine (5-HTQ), a potent 5-HT3 receptor agonist, and has been found exclusively in Inocybe aeruginascens so far. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Mycetism or mycetismus (mushroom poisoning) is caused by toxins present in the basidiomata even after it is properly cooked. There are mainly seven different types of poisoning syndromes (Phalloides syndrome, Orellanus syndrome, Gyromitra syndrome, Muscarin syndrome, Pantherina syndrome, Psilocybin syndrome, and Gastrointestinal syndrome), along with Paxillus syndrome and coprine syndrome. The Indian subcontinent consists of several ecoclimatic zones and it is a treasure trove of fungal diversity. In fact, the Western Ghats, which form a long mountainous region along the west coast of India, is considered as one of the hot spots of biodiversity. The mushroom biota of this large country is still not explored fully and to date only about 1200 species of fungi belonging to the orders Agaricales, Russulales, and Boletales are described in comparison to about 14,000 species of mushrooms reported from all over the world. This represents only 10% of the world biota of mushrooms, and the majority of the other 90% remain to be discovered in the tropical regions of the world. The present review deals with the distribution of poisonous and hallucinogenic species of mushrooms described from India. A survey of the literature reveals the species of fungi belonging to various genera that are reported from India, which cause the major types of mushroom poisoning syndromes. Among the total number of mushrooms reported from India, only a very small percentage are poisonous or hallucinogenic. Even though there are several reports in the newspapers about poisoning after consumption of mushrooms, there is only one report of a clinically proven case of mushroom poisoning by Chlorophyllum molybdites in India. There is a need for greater awareness of mushroom poisoning among the general public and clinicians in India. The need of a database of poisonous mushrooms and the symptoms of mushroom poisoning along with the germ plasm collections is emphasized. There is a great need of chemical investigations of Indian mushrooms for their active principles, which can possibly be used in a wide range of metabolic and infectious diseases, such as cancer, AIDS, and others. © 2006 by Begell House, Inc.

N2  - "Magic mushroom (MM)" is the name most commonly given to psychoactive fungi containing the hallucinogenic components: psilocin (1) and psilocybin (2). We investigated the rRNA gene (internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU)) of two Panaeolus species and four Psilocybe species fungi (of these, two are non-psilocybin species). On the basis of sequence alignment, we improved the identification system developed in our previous study. In this paper, we describe the new system capable of distinguishing MMs from non-psilocybin Psilocybe species, its application data and the phylogeny of MM species. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - Dysregulation of thalamic sensory 'transmission' in schizophrenia: Neurochemical vulnerability to hallucinations
A1  - Behrendt R.-P. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Cholinergic arousal mechanisms predispose thalamic and cortical neurons to fire action potentials at gamma rhythms, which have a tendency to resonate in thalamocortical networks, thereby forming coherent assemblies under constraints of sensory input to specific thalamic nuclei, on the one hand, and prefrontal and limbic attentional mechanisms, on the other. Perception may be based on sustained assemblies of coherent gamma oscillations in thalamocortical circuits. In schizophrenia, the impact of sensory input on self-organization of thalamocortical activity may be generally reduced. As a result, processes underlying perception can become uncoupled from sensory input, particularly at times of hyperarousal, leading to domination of attentional mechanisms and the emergence of hallucinations. Evidence is reviewed that implicates excessive neuronal noise in specific thalamic nuclei in the generation of hallucinations in schizophrenia. Nicotinic receptor abnormalities, dopaminergic hyperactivity and glutamate-receptor hypofunction are reconciled within a model of psychotic symptom generation that places crucial emphasis on dysfunction of the reticular thalamic nucleus. © 2006 British Association for Psychopharmacology.

N2  - This paper describes a procedure for the determination of psilocin and psilocybin in mushroom extracts using high-performance liquid chromatography with postcolumn chemiluminescence detection. A number of extraction methods for psilocin and psilocybin in hallucinogenic mushrooms were investigated, with a simple methanolic extraction being found to be most effective. Psilocin and psilocybin were extracted from a variety of hallucinogenic mushrooms using methanol. The analytes were separated on a C12 column using a (95:5% v/v) methanol:10 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.5 mobile phase with a run time of 5 min. Detection was realized through a dual reagent chemiluminescence detection system of acidic potassium permanganate and tris(2,2'-bipyridyl) ruthenium(II). The chemiluminescence detection system gave improved detectability when compared with UV absorption at 269 nm, with detection limits of 1.2 x 10-8 and 3.5 x 10-9 mol/L being obtained for psilocin and psilocybin, respectively. The procedure was applied to the determination of psilocin and psilocybin in three Australian species of hallucinogenic mushroom. Copyright © 2005 by American Academy of Forensic Sciences.

T1  - Neurobiological and molecular bases of methamphetamine-induce behavioral sensitization and spontaneous recurrence of methamphetamine psychosis, and its implication in schizophrenia
A1  - Yui K.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Spontaneous recurrence of methamphetamine- or amphetamine-induced paranoid hallucinatory psychosis (i.e., flashbacks) occasionally occurs in response to non-specific mild stress in drug-free patients with a history of methamphetamine- or amphetamine-induced psychosis. Stress sensitization associated with noradrenergic hyperactivity and increased dopamine release may be related to this flashbacks. Stressful frightening experiences as well as fear-related paranoid-hallucinatory states during methamphetamine use may be related to these stress sensitization. Robust noradrenergic hyperactivity with increased dopamine release may predicts subsequent flashback episodes. Schizophrenia-like symptoms (e.g., passivity phenomena, Gedankenlautwerden, and thought disorder such as circumstantiality and egorrhea symptoms) appear to develop related to dopaminergic hyperactivity. One of the dopamine receptor-encoding genes DRD2, TaqIA A1/A1 type, with which reduced density of the D2 receptor is associated, reduces to the risk of development of flashbacks. Stress sensitization has been proposed as a key step in the progression from vulnerability to an overt paranoid-hallucinatory states, so that schizophrenia and flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis shares common underlying mechanisms of stress sensitization. Compared to flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis, psychedelic drug flashbacks are the recurrence of a perception learned while an individual is experiencing high anxiety levels, and thus recur in anxiety-related situations. Anxiety or fear during drug use is an important factor in the development of flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis and also psychedelic drug flashbacks. Dopaminergic and glutamatergic neural circuits including the striatum, nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex play an important role in the development of psychostimulant-induced long-lasting behavioral sensitization. Immediate early genes expression in the particular brain regions affected by the psychostimulants is involved in this process. Furthermore, recent advances in molecular analysis could shed light on the fundamental mechanism involved, by identifying specific participating molecules such as delta FosB, NAC1, G-protein b1 subunit and methamphetamine-responsive transcript 1b. © 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

T1  - The role of the extrapersonal brain systems in religious activity
A1  - Previc F.H. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - The neuropsychology of religious activity in normal and selected clinical populations is reviewed. Religious activity includes beliefs, experiences, and practice. Neuropsychological and functional imaging findings, many of which have derived from studies of experienced meditators, point to a ventral cortical axis for religious behavior, involving primarily the ventromedial temporal and frontal regions. Neuropharmacological studies generally point to dopaminergic activation as the leading neurochemical feature associated with religious activity. The ventral dopaminergic pathways involved in religious behavior most closely align with the action-extrapersonal system in the model of 3-D perceptual-motor interactions proposed by Previc (1998). These pathways are biased toward distant (especially upper) space and also mediate related extrapersonally dominated brain functions such as dreaming and hallucinations. Hyperreligiosity is a major feature of mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, temporal-lobe epilepsy and related disorders, in which the ventromedial dopaminergic systems are highly activated and exaggerated attentional or goal-directed behavior toward extrapersonal space occurs. The evolution of religion is linked to an expansion of dopaminergic systems in humans, brought about by changes in diet and other physiological influences. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Anecdotal reports suggest that psychedelic agents may relieve symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This modified double-blind study investigated the safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of psilocybin, a potent 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/2C agonist, in patients with OCD. Method: Nine subjects with DSM-IV-defined OCD and no other current major psychiatric disorder participated in up to 4 single-dose exposures to psilocybin in doses ranging from subhallucinogenic to frankly hallucinogenic. Low (100 mug/kg), medium (200 mug/kg), and high (300 mug/kg) doses were assigned in that order, and a very low dose (25 mug/kg) was inserted randomly and in double-blind fashion at any time after the first dose. Testing days were separated by at least 1 week. Each session was conducted over an 8-hour period in a controlled environment in an outpatient clinic; subjects were then transferred to a psychiatric inpatient unit for overnight observation. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) and a visual analog scale measuring overall obsessive-compulsive symptom severity were administered at 0, 4, 8, and 24 hours post-ingestion. The Hallucinogen Rating Scale was administered at 8 hours, and vital signs were recorded at 0, 1, 4, 8, and 24 hours after ingestion. The study was conducted from November 2001 to November 2004. Results: Nine subjects were administered a total of 29 psilocybin doses. One subject experienced transient hypertension without relation to anxiety or somatic symptoms, but no other significant adverse effects were observed. Marked decreases in OCD symptoms of variable degrees were observed in all subjects during 1 or more of the testing sessions (23%-100% decrease in YBOCS score). Repeated-measures analysis of variance for all YBOCS values revealed a significant main effect of time on Wilks lambda (F = 9.86, df = 3,3; p = .046), but no significant effect of dose (F = 2.25, df = 3,3; p = .261) or interaction of time and dose (F = 0.923, df = 9,45; p = .515). Improvement generally lasted past the 24-hour timepoint. Conclusions: In a controlled clinical environment, psilocybin was safely used in subjects with OCD and was associated with acute reductions in core OCD symptoms in several subjects.

T1  - Toward a neurobiology of body dysmorphic disorder
A1  - Saxena S.
A1  - Feusner J.D. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Despite its prevalence and clinical significance, very little is known about the neurobiology of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). However, information about the possible neurobiologic substrates of BDD is starting to emerge. Family and genetic studies suggest that BDD is a hereditary disorder. There is indirect psychopharmacologic evidence implicating serotonin in modulating BDD symptoms. Neuropsychological studies demonstrate abnormalities in memory, executive functioning, emotion recognition, and visual self-perception. Case studies of BDD symptoms resulting from brain damage implicate right temporal regions. Studies of the neural basis of body image distortion suggest both involvement of the right parahippocampal gyms in appraisals of body image, and dysfunction of specific temporal and parietal cortical regions in mediating distorted visual self-perception. Reactions of disgust and anxiety to visual perceptions, which are fundamental processes in BDD patients, may be due to excessive activation of the insula and amygdala. The neurobiologic basis of BDD is likely a complex interplay of dysfunctions in several neural systems. A combination of dysfunctions in frontal-subcortical circuits, right temporal and parietal cortical areas, and limbic structures may produce both the symptoms and neurocognitive deficits characteristic of BDD.

N2  - Rationale: Although psilocybin has been used for centuries for religious purposes, little is known scientifically about its acute and persisting effects. Objectives: This double-blind study evaluated the acute and longer-term psychological effects of a high dose of psilocybin relative to a comparison compound administered under comfortable, supportive conditions. Materials and methods: The participants were hallucinogen-naive adults reporting regular participation in religious or spiritual activities. Two or three sessions were conducted at 2-month intervals. Thirty volunteers received orally administered psilocybin (30 mg/70 kg) and methylphenidate hydrochloride (40 mg/70 kg) in counterbalanced order. To obscure the study design, six additional volunteers received methylphenidate in the first two sessions and unblinded psilocybin in a third session. The 8-h sessions were conducted individually. Volunteers were encouraged to close their eyes and direct their attention inward. Study monitors rated volunteers' behavior during sessions. Volunteers completed questionnaires assessing drug effects and mystical experience immediately after and 2 months after sessions. Community observers rated changes in the volunteer's attitudes and behavior. Results: Psilocybin produced a range of acute perceptual changes, subjective experiences, and labile moods including anxiety. Psilocybin also increased measures of mystical experience. At 2 months, the volunteers rated the psilocybin experience as having substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance and attributed to the experience sustained positive changes in attitudes and behavior consistent with changes rated by community observers. Conclusions: When administered under supportive conditions, psilocybin occasioned experiences similar to spontaneously occurring mystical experiences. The ability to occasion such experiences prospectively will allow rigorous scientific investigations of their causes and consequences. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

T1  - Mechanisms of action of current and potential pharmacotherapies of obsessive-compulsive disorder
A1  - El Mansari M.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - A significant body of evidence documented that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the head of caudate nucleus are involved in the mediation of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms. Potent serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the only antidepressant agents thus far shown to be effective in the treatment of OCD. The present review summarizes information on 5-HT release and the adaptive changes in pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT receptors sensitivity induced by SRI treatment in rat and guinea pig structures involved in OCD. It emphasizes that the time course for the occurrence of increased 5-HT release and terminal 5-HT1D desensitization is congruent with the delayed therapeutic response to SRI in OCD. In addition, a greater dose of SRI inducing a greater degree of reuptake inhibition may play an essential role in this phenomenon. This is consistent with the common clinical observation that high doses of SRIs are sometimes necessary to obtain an anti-OCD effect, and with the results of some fixed-dose double blind trials showing a dose-dependent therapeutic effect of SRIs. It is hypothesized that enhanced 5-HT release in the OFC is mediated by the activation of normosensitive postsynaptic 5-HT2-like receptors and underlies the therapeutic action of SRI in OCD. This is supported by the beneficial effect of some hallucinogens with 5-HT2 agonistic properties in obtaining a more rapid therapeutic response. Finally, based on this knowledge, new strategies aimed at producing more rapid, effective and safe anti-OCD drugs, such as a selective action on terminal 5-HT1D receptors, on 5-HT2 receptors as well as on the glutamate system, are discussed. © 2005.

T1  - Glutamate involvement in schizophrenia: Focus on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors
A1  - Javitt D.C. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain, accounting for >60% of neurons. Overactivity of glutamatergic function has been linked to excitotoxicity in disorders such as stroke and epilepsy, which underfunctioning may lead to acute or chronic encephalopathies. Selective dysfunction or dysregulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors may play a specific role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Recent studies have investigated the ability of NMDA/glycine-site modulators to ameliorate persistent negative and cognitive symptoms. Several full or partial glycine-site agonists, including glycine, D-serine and D-cycloserine, have shown effectiveness in small-scale clinical trials. Glycine levels in brain are regulated by glycine type I amino acid transporters. Recently developed glycine transport inhibitors show preclinical behavioral effects similar to those of glycine oro-serine, and may represent a "next generation" approach to the treatment of persistent negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.

N2  - An SAR study of psilocybin and psilocin derivatives reveals that 1-methylpsilocin is a selective agonist at the h5-HT2C receptor. The corresponding phosphate derivative, 1-methylpsilocybin, shows efficacy in an animal model for obsessive-compulsive disorder, as does 4-fluoro-N,N- dimethyltryptamine. These results suggest a new area for development of novel 5-HT2C agonists with applications for drug discovery. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - To investigate the trend of non-controlled drugs of abuse, simultaneous analytical methods were developed using GC-MS and LC-ESI-MS for 8 tryptamines/beta-carbolines, 6 phenethylamines of typically non-controlled substances in Japan, and, additionally, five legally controlled tryptamines and phenethylamines originally found in fungi or plants. Moreover, the proposed methods were applied to analyses of these drugs in 99 kinds of products (a total number of 123 products purchased at adult shops or via the Internet over the past 2 years in Japan), which potentially advertised psychotropic/psychoactive effects. The samples were extracted with methanol under ultrasonication. After centrifugation, the extracts were filtered prior to injections. GC-MS analysis was performed using a DB-5MS capillary column. Regarding the LC-ESI-MS analysis; the separation of the target drugs was optimized on an ODS column in acetonitrile/MeOH (7:3)-10 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 3.5)/acetonitrile (95:5) by a linear gradient program and a quantitative analysis was carried out by the monitoring of each [M + H]+ in the positive ion mode of ESI-MS. As a result of the analyses using GC-MS and LC-ESI-MS, 5-MeO-DIPT (the synthetic substance known by the street name "Foxy") was found in 8 out of the 99 kinds of products. Additionally, AMT (from brown powder), DMT (from dried plant), harmine and harmaline (from dried plant) were also found in some of the 99 products. These analytical methods could be useful for the investigation of the distribution of the non-controlled psychotropic tryptamines/beta-carbolines and phenethylamines in the market. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The recurrence of flashbacks without acute or chronic hallucinogen consumption has been recognized in the DSM IV criteria as the hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD). Perceptual disturbances may last for 5:years or more and represent a real psychosocial distress. We reported here a case of a 18-year-old young man presenting HPPD after a mixed intoxication with psylocibin and cannabis. This report shows symptomatic recurrences persisting more than 8 months. Various differential diagnoses were evoked and our therapeutic strategies were described. © 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - Mushrooms are ubiquitous in nature. They are an important source of nutrition, however, certain varieties contain chemicals that can be highly toxic to humans. Industrially cultivated mushrooms are historically very safe, whereas foraging for mushrooms or accidental ingestion of mushrooms in the environment can result in serious illness and death. The emergency department is the most common site of presentation for patients suffering from acute mushroom poisoning. Although recognition can be facilitated by identification of a characteristic toxidrome, the presenting manifestations can be variable and have considerable overlap with more common and generally benign clinical syndromes. The goal of this two-part article is to review the knowledge base on this subject and provide information that will assist the clinician in the early consideration, diagnosis and treatment of mushroom poisoning. Part I reviewed the epidemiology and demographics of mushroom poisoning, the physical characteristics of the most toxic varieties, the classification of the toxic species, and presented an overview of the cyclopeptide-containing mushroom class. Part II is focused on the presentation of the other classes of toxic mushrooms along with an up-to-date review of the most recently identified poisonous varieties. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Hallucinogenic botanicals of America: A growing need for focused drug education and research
A1  - Halpern J.H.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Botanical sources for medicines in America have been known since long before the arrival of Columbus. Nevertheless, both scientists and the general public are often unaware that some of these botanical drugs are also potent intoxicants. We provide a quick overview of hallucinogenic and dissociative drugs harvested from nature or that are openly and legally cultivated in the United States. Examples of harmful outcomes reported in the media are contrasted with existing responsible ingestion by others, some of whom have the protected right to do so for traditional or sacramental religious purposes. Despite an ongoing and expensive effort to warn people of the potential harms of recreational drug use, little is known about the extent of use of these psychoactive botanicals, and the recent explosion of information available via the Internet could herald a storm of morbidity to come. Mounting more targeted research and educational efforts today may reduce later use and abuse, inform society about the special circumstances of religious use, and better prepare clinicians and other health care providers about the issues involved when people choose to indigenously source psychoactive drugs for human consumption. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Increasing evidence suggests a link between attention, working memory, serotonin (5-HT), and prefrontal cortex activity. In an attempt to tease out the relationship between these elements, this study tested the effects of the hallucinogenic mixed 5-HT1A/2A receptor agonist psilocybin alone and after pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin. Eight healthy human volunteers were tested on a multiple-object tracking task and spatial working memory task under the four conditions: placebo, psilocybin (215 mug/kg), ketanserin (50 mg), and psilocybin and ketanserin. Psilocybin significantly reduced attentional tracking ability, but had no significant effect on spatial working memory, suggesting a functional dissociation between the two tasks. Pretreatment with ketanserin did not attenuate the effect of psilocybin on attentional performance, suggesting a primary involvement of the 5-HT1A receptor in the observed deficit. Based on physiological and pharmacological data, we speculate that this impaired attentional performance may reflect a reduced ability to suppress or ignore distracting stimuli rather than reduced attentional capacity. The clinical relevance of these results is also discussed. © 2005 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

N2  - The degree of alkylation of the side chain nitrogen in tryptamines is one important factor that affects psychoactivity. The method of Speeter and Anthony is considered to be one of the most important synthetic preparative methods. The final step in this reaction is based on the reduction of a (substituted) indole-3-yl-glyoxalylamide to the desired tryptamine with metal hydride. Twelve symmetrically and 13 asymmetrically N,N-disubstituted glyoxalylamides and their corresponding tryptamine derivatives have been synthesised and characterised by gas chromatography EI-ion trap mass spectrometry, electrospray-triple quadrupole-tandem mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Mass spectral and NMR similarities and differences between the investigated compounds are discussed. A solvent dependency is observed that has to be taken into consideration for the unambiguous assignment of 1H- and 13C-NMR chemical shifts. The 1H-NMR study demonstrated that one can evaluate the rotamer populations of the asymmetrical glyoxalylamides. In a forensic or clinical scenario where single or multiple reaction monitoring approaches are contemplated, the appropriate ion transitions of choice may then focus on the two main fragmentations, namely beta-cleavage ([M+H]+ -> CH2N+R2R3) and/or alpha-cleavage ([M+H]+ -> [3-vinylindole]+), respectively. The synthesis, NMR and MS analytical data presented provide the forensic analyst and clinical biochemist with a detailed and self-consistent body of information and mechanisms for the spectral identification of the more likely psychoactive tryptamines that may be met. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2005.

N2  - Accurate and sensitive analytical methods for psilocin (PC) and psilocybin (PB), tryptamine-type hallucinogens contained in "magic mushrooms," were investigated using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The chromatographic separation on an ODS column and mass spectral information gave complete discrimination between PC and PB without derivatization. The mass spectrometric detection had a high sensitivity, and the tandem mass spectrometric detection provided more specificity and accuracy, as well as high sensitivity. The detection limits ranged from 1 to 25 pg by LC-MS in the selected ion monitoring mode, and the intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation were estimated to be 4.21-5.93% by LC-MS-MS in the selected reaction monitoring mode. By applying the present LC-MS-MS technique to four real samples, the contents of PC and PB were found to vary over a wide range (0.60-1.4 and 0.18-3.8 mg/g dry wt. for PC and PB, respectively) between samples.

N2  - Sinus tachycardia, in the forms of four distinct rhythm disturbances, is frequently encountered in clinical practice but is often overlooked. The most common rhythm, normal sinus tachycardia, whether physiologic, pathologic or iatrogenic, is predominantly catecholamine driven, is virtually asymptomatic and is managed by identifying and treating the underlying cause. The other so-called primary sinus tachycardias, which include inappropriate sinus tachycardia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and sinus node re-entry tachycardia, have fundamentally different clinical features, basic underlying etiologic mechanisms and treatment strategies. Differentiation of these types from normal sinus tachycardia and from other atrial arrhythmias is crucial for successful management. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy of the sinus tachycardias not only prevents multiple consultations but might also have important long-term prognostic implications.

T1  - Novel hypothesis for the cause of panic disorder via the neuroepithelial bodies in the lung
A1  - Fukuda K. 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Panic disorder (PD) is a complex condition that is further complicated by its numerous inducers, which include hypercapnia, hypoxia, sodium lactate, caffeine and cholecystokinin. It seems unlikely that there are specific suffocation receptors for each of these inducers in the brain. The pulmonary neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs), which are situated at the bifurcation point of the small bronchi, act as storage cells for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and sensors for suffocation. If we suppose that PD might represent an inflammation of the NEBs, bradykinin (BK) which augments the airway hyper-response to diverse indcers might cause these cells to release 5-HT along with peptides and panneuroendcrine markers from their dence-core secretory granules. It was revealed that BK with 5-HT could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). When 5-HT released from these cells along with BK cross the BBB, the release of 5-HT at the axonal terminals in the serotonergic neurons in the brain will be inhibited, since the 5-HT1 autoreceptor have a higher affinity for 5-HT than do the 5-HT2 receptors. The inhibition of 5-HT at the axonal terminal causes to suppress the periaqueductal gray matter, which inhibits flight reactions to impending danger, pain or asphyxia. In short, this serotonergic situation might bring about PD. According to this theory, the type of inducer that the PD patient is exposed to is unimportant as long as it stimulates the NEBs, and through the effect of 5-HT and BK, PD would be revaluated as a somatic disease that directly and reversibly affects the brain. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - We report results of a FDG-PET study in 10 patients with schizophrenia (6 unmedicated, 4 never medicated) and 12 healthy age-matched controls. The patients met ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and all reported psychotic, "positive" symptoms when tested. Schizophrenic patients had higher absolute CMRGlu values in almost all quantified regions compared to normal subjects. Using the occipital cortex as the reference region patients showed a hyperfrontal metabolic pattern. Other significant regional differences were found with respect to thalamus, striatum and temporal cortex. The finding of a hyperfrontality in un- and never medicated psychotic schizophrenic patients must be discussed in the light of the psychopathological symptoms of patients when tested, a possible disruption of cortico-striato-thalamic feedback loops and recent findings of a hyperfrontality in experimentally induced psychosis (ketamine- and psilocybin-model of schizophrenia).

T1  - The entheomycological origin of Egyptian crowns and the esoteric underpinnings of Egyptian religion
A1  - Berlant S.R. 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - In this paper, I theorize that the Egyptian White and Triple Crowns were originally primordia of the entheogenic Psilocybe (Stropharia) cubensis, which an Egyptian tale known as Cheops and the Magicians allegorically explained grew on barley, and that Osiris was the God of spiritual rebirth because he personified this and other entheogenic mushrooms. I go on to theorize that the plant known commonly as the Eye of Horus, which the Egyptians included in cakes and ales designed to spiritually rebirth the living and the dead, was an entheogenic mushroom cap entirely analogous, if not identical, to Soma. Finally, I explain why so many scholars failed to discern these identities and relationships for so long. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - While there is a long-standing tradition of using behavioral methods to study the effects of manufactured drugs and environmental chemicals, comparatively little attention has focused until recently on the behavioral effects of marine or freshwater toxins. A vast array of microorganisms, found in a variety of waters, are known to occasionally "bloom" and produce toxins that can cause either blatant toxicity (i.e., lethality) or damage to a number of organ systems. The nervous system is a known target for many of the toxins. Considerable research has in the past been carried out to determine toxin effects on the survivability of laboratory rodents (typically mice) following acute exposures. Newer research has shown, however, prominent toxin-induced alterations in motor, sensory, autonomic and cognitive functions at sublethal exposure concentrations. Future toxin research can capitalize upon a wealth of behavioral paradigms already available in toxicology, pharmacology and neuroscience. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: Pharmacological challenges with hallucinogens are used as models for psychosis in experimental research. The state induced by glutamate antagonists such as phencyclidine PCP) is often considered as a more appropriate model of psychosis than the state induced by serotonergic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). However, so far, the psychological profiles of the two types of hallucinogenic drugs have never been studied directly in an experimental within-subject design. Methods: Fifteen healthy volunteers were included in a double-blind, crossover study with two doses of the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist DMT and the glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist (S)-ketamine. Results: Data are reported for nine subjects who completed both experimental days with both doses of the two drugs. The intensity of global psychological effects was similar for DMT and (S)-ketamine. However, phenomena resembling positive symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly positive formal thought disorder and inappropriate affect, were stronger after DMT. Phenomena resembling negative symptoms of schizophrenia, attention deficits, body perception disturbances and catatonia-like motor phenomena were stronger after (S)-ketamine. Discussion: The present study suggests that the NMDA antagonist model of psychosis is not overall superior to the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist model. Rather, the two classes of drugs tend to model different aspects or types of schizophrenia. The NMDA antagonist state may be an appropriate model for psychoses with prominent negative and possibly also catatonic features, while the 5-HT 2A agonist state may be a better model for psychoses of the paranoid type. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

N2  - About 70 different chemicals have been used or stock-pilled as CW agents during 20th century. CW agents classified such as their effects: nerve agents, vesican agents, choking agents, riot control agents, incapacitating agents, blood agents and plant toxins. The counter-measures, antidotes and their effects, therapy and new investigations discussed. CW agents was used during wars and while peaceful time by the terrorist and may be use again. These agents range from that cause death quickly, such as the nerve agents and cyanid, to those with effects beginning hours after exposure, such as mustard and pulmonary agents. Medical personel must be prepared to diagnose and management. To do this, they must have equipment, antidotes and knowledge.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - This review summarizes the latest literature on "party" or "club" drugs, defined as MDMA, GHB, ketamine, and Rohypnol, as published from 2002 to early 2005. Club drugs have been categorized as being used at raves and dance parties. The literature shows that each drug has different properties, users, and settings. Each drug has different adverse effects and requires different acute care protocols. Although these drugs were identified early, scientific information about them, including the toxicological tests to identify them, is still evolving. Increasing numbers of studies on the short- and long-term effects of these drugs on humans are being published, but because of limitations on research using human subjects, they may not always be as rigorous as desired and can be cited by drug users to discredit findings of harm. The lack of research-based information on these drugs has led to the emergence of web sites that may or may not provide accurate data. Evaluated chemical dependency treatment protocols using the latest research for each of these different drugs are needed. Copyright © 2005 Taylor & Francis Inc.

T1  - Club drug use among delinquent youth

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The availability and use of club drugs have increased in the last decade. Media and researchers have responded with increased coverage and a variety of studies. Despite the increased attention, some of these drugs and the rave/club scene in which they seemingly gained popularity are relatively new. Questions remain about the people who use club drugs, how best to go about preventing or dealing with the use of these substances, and the social contexts, subcultures, and manner in which club drugs are used. Complicating matters, the use and users of club drugs seem to be continually evolving. Club drugs are reportedly now available and used in a wide variety of locations, and the users are changing demographically. Members of racial/ethnic groups who previously avoided club drugs are beginning to use these substances, and the average age of onset appears to be decreasing. Additional research on the epidemiology of club drug use among samples that are demographically and geographically diverse is needed. This study is an analysis of factors associated with several measures of club drug use among a sample of delinquent youth in Oregon. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses are used to identify factors associated with club drug use and determine whether the current grouping of club drugs is appropriate. Findings indicate that users of club drugs are significantly different from delinquent youth who have not used club drugs on a number of dimensions, including age, engagement in risk behaviors, victimization, home environment, and rave attendance.

N2  - Participation in raw parties and other similar events is a regular form of entertainment of adolescents. No objections can be made against such gatherings if adolescents stay "drug free" on these occasions. However, in "techno" style parties, accompanied by noisy music and light effects, young people often experiment with taking various drugs, including high amount of synthetic ones. The authors present the data about the effect of the most frequently used drugs of herbal and synthetic origin with stimulative or hallucinogenic effect. The authors present a specific effect of drugs particularly on the reproductive system of an adolescent girl, and in case of her pregnancy, they also describe the effect of drugs on the course of pregnancy and health status of the foetus. The list of application routes should direct an attending doctor's attention to possible modes of drug administration. The description of drug effects is aimed at improving differential diagnostics that can cause problems mainly in pregnancy. The conclusion presents the international system of drug addiction monitoring and joining of Slovakia in this system.

N2  - Substance abuse is among one of the major problems plaguing our society. It has come to the attention of several health-care professionals that a communication gap exists between themselves and substance abusers. Most of the time the substance abusers are only familiar with the slang terms of abused substances, a terminology that medical professionals are usually unaware of. This paper is an attempt to close that communication gap, allowing health care professionals to understand the slang terminology that their patients use, thus enabling them to make appropriate treatment decisions. In addition, the article presents some key features (including active ingredient, pharmacological classification, medical use, abuse form, usage method, combinations used, effects sought, long-term possible effects, and detectability in urine) of the most commonly abused substances.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - A high variety of factors were found to be implicated in the emergence of depersonalization episodes. The remarkable case of a patient who developed a hemi-depersonalization syndrome is reported in a patient with known obsessive-compulsive disorder. He complained of feeling his left half of the body as if it was detached from him. The part of the body that was perceived as estranged was inconsistent with the anatomical distribution of the nervous system as the entire left part of his body was concerned, from head to toe. He always remained aware that the sensations were not real, and felt like being an outside observer of the left side of his body. He also developed an isolated delusional idea. The hemi-depersonalization syndrome as well as the delusional idea did not respond to citalopram 20 mg/day, but remitted rapidly under olanzapine 10 mg/day, the obsessive-compulsive symptomatology persisting for several weeks. From the course of hemi-depersonalization syndrome and the available literature, it is concluded that this syndrome is independent from the concomitant OCD and that the observed hemi-depersonalization syndrome is likely to be a manifestation of a psychotic reaction which consisted of both the hemi-depersonalization and delusions. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Since June 6, 2002, psilocin and psilocybin-containing fungi (commonly called "magic mushrooms") have been regulated by the Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law in Japan. However, various fly agaric-related products are now entering the Japanese market via the internet. In this study, fly agaric-related products available in this way were investigated for raw materials by DNA analysis and for additives by chemical analysis. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the mitochondrial 12S rDNA region suggested that these fly agaric-related products originate from A. muscaria or A. muscaria var. persicina. Furthermore, they were classified into three strains based on the ITS2-LSU nucleotide sequence. Harmine derivatives and/or tryptamine derivatives were detected in some of these products by LC/MS analysis. In accordance with this, the matK gene of Peganum harmala was found in all of the harmine derivative-containing samples.

N2  - Purpose of review: During the last few years, drug abuse has risen to the point that almost 20 million Americans are current abusers of illicit substances. These patients present to us as anesthesiologists in a variety of circumstances: in obstetrics for labor and emergencies, in trauma for emergency surgeries or life-saving (resuscitative) situations and in everyday elective surgeries. Therefore it is important for anesthesiologists to know about the most common illicit drugs being used, to know their side effects and clinical presentation if abused or intoxicated, and to know what anesthetic options would be beneficial or detrimental. Recent findings: In this article we will review some of the most commonly used illicit drugs, their effects on the organ systems and some tips to take into consideration when providing anesthesia for these patients. We will discuss marijuana, cocaine, opioids, hallucinogens, solvents and the newer so-called rave or club drugs. Newer treatment options for opioid detoxification will also be discussed. Summary: Illicit substance abuse is a major health concern in the United States. Drug use, either acute or chronic, has potentially grave consequences which include changes affecting the pulmonary, cardiovascular, nervous, renal and hepatic systems. Anesthesiologist come into contact with these patients in emergency and everyday situations. Due to the diverse clinical presentations that may arise from single substance or polysubstance abuse, anesthetic management should be tailored to each individual and universal precautions should always be followed when providing care. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Binocular rivalry occurs when different images are presented simultaneously to corresponding points within the left and right eyes. Under these conditions, the observer's perception will alternate between the two perceptual alternatives. Motivated by the reported link between the rate of perceptual alternations, symptoms of psychosis and an incidental observation that the rhythmicity of perceptual alternations during binocular rivalry was greatly increased 10h after the consumption of LSD, this study aimed to investigate the pharmacology underlying binocular rivalry and to explore the connection between the timing of perceptual switching and psychosis. Psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, PY) was chosen for the study because, like LSD, it is known to act as an agonist at serotonin (5-HT)1A and 5-HT2A receptors and to produce an altered state sometimes marked by psychosis-like symptoms. A total of 12 healthy human volunteers were tested under placebo, low-dose (115 mug/kg) and high-dose (250 mug/kg) PY conditions. In line with predictions, under both low- and high-dose conditions, the results show that at 90 min postadministration (the peak of drug action), rate and rhythmicity of perceptual alternations were significantly reduced from placebo levels. Following the 90 min testing period, the perceptual switch rate successively increased, with some individuals showing increases well beyond pretest levels at the final testing, 360 min postadministration. However, as some subjects had still not returned to pretest levels by this time, the mean phase duration at 360 min was not found to differ significantly from placebo. Reflecting the drug-induced changes in rivalry phase durations, subjects showed clear changes in psychological state as indexed by the 5D-ASC (altered states of consciousness) rating scales. This study suggests the involvement of serotonergic pathways in binocular rivalry and supports the previously proposed role of a brainstem oscillator in perceptual rivalry alternations and symptoms of psychosis. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

T1  - Use of nonprohibited hallucinogenic plants: Increasing relevance for public health? A case report and literature review on the consumption of Salvia divinorum (Diviner's Sage)

N2  - Introduction: We want to call attention to a mint plant, called diviner's sage (Salvia divinorum), originally used in shamanic ceremonies of the Mazatec Indians of Mexico. On numerous websites of the internet, this ancient herbal drug and its extracts are offered as a legal means of widening individual awareness. Regarding its dose-response relationship, the active ingredient, salvinorin A, is one of the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogens. Laws on controlled substances, except for Finland, Denmark and Australia, do not prohibit cultivating, consuming or dealing with Salvia divinorum. Ingestion by smoking, vaporising or chewing, induces a short-lived inebriant state with intense, bizarre feelings of depersonalization. This article wants to be a signal for physicians or psychotherapists to take Salvia into consideration, when exploring young people for drug use. Methods: We report the individual perceptions of a young man consuming Salvia divinorum. We review the scarce scientific literature and consider relevant internet websites. Discussion: We define open issues for further investigations and try to discuss why Salvia divinorum may be of interest for teenagers and young adults in Europe.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This paper describes two cases with khat- and two with psilocybin-induced psychoses and draws attention to the medical and social consequences of the use of these drugs. METHOD: Two male patients are presented who developed relapsing and short-lasting psychotic episodes after chewing kath leaves. In addition, two male patients are reported who showed an acute exacerbation of psychosis after ingestion of psilocybin mushrooms. In addition, a review of the literature is presented. RESULTS: The khat-induced psychotic symptoms disappeared without any treatment within one week. One of the patients with a psilocybin-induced psychosis was treated with risperidone. In the other, symptomatology subsided in a few days. No somatic medical complications occurred. CONCLUSION: Adequate psychiatric diagnosis and treatment of the psychoses and the negative social consequences of the use of these drugs are stressed as well as the delineation from functional psychoses in cases of chronic use. The latter applies to patients with psychiatric comorbidity in particular.

T1  - Serotonin receptors represents highly favorable molecular targets for cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia and other disorders
A1  - Roth B.L.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Rationale: Current treatments for schizophrenia adequately treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia but only modestly improve cognitive deficits. This review provides evidence for and against the use of selective 5-HT receptor drugs as cognition enhancing agents for schizophrenia and other disorders. Methods: Pre-clinical and clinical literature concerned with the role of the serotonergic system in cognition and memory as it relates to schizophrenia is reviewed. Individual 5-HT receptor subtypes for which selective drugs are available that are likely to improve cognition are reviewed. Recommendations for clinical testing are proposed. Results and conclusions: Four 5-HT receptor systems (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT4, 5-HT6) are highlighted as suitable targets for enhancing cognition and memory. Because many clinically available antipsychotic drugs already target 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT6 receptors, design of clinical trials will need to take into account the serotonergic pharmacology of concurrently administered antipsychotic medications. 5-HT1A partial agonists and 5-HT2A antagonists have shown modest effectiveness in improving cognition in schizophrenia. 5-HT6-selective compounds for cognition enhancement are in late-stage clinical trials, while 5-HT4 compounds have not yet been tested in humans for cognition enhancement. Recommendations: For stand-alone therapy for enhancing cognition, 5-HT 1A partial agonists, 5-HT2A antagonists, 5-HT4 partial agonists and 5-HT6 antagonists are all likely to induce at least modest improvement in cognition in schizophrenia. If "add-on therapy" is contemplated, antipsychotic drugs with weak affinities for serotonin receptors should be used to avoid confounds. It is likely that serotonergic drugs will soon be available as cognition enhancing medications for disorders other than schizophrenia (e.g. dementia). © Springer-Verlag 2003.

N2  - This study was performed on a representative sample of the Danish population in order to investigate the connection to the use of psychoactive drugs and quality of life (QOL) by way of a questionnaire-based survey. The questionnaire was mailed in February 1993 to 2,460 persons aged between 18 and 88, randomly selected from the CPR (Danish Central Register), and 7,222 persons from the Copenhagen Perinatal Birth Cohort 1959-61. A total of 1,501 persons between the ages 18 and 88 years and 4,626 persons between the ages 31 and 33 years returned the questionnaire (response rates of 61.0% and 64.1%, respectively). Variables investigated in this study were ten different psychotropic drugs and quality of life. Our study showed that over half the Danish population had used illegal psychotropic drugs. The most commonly used was cannabis (marijuana) though experience of this drug appeared not to co-vary with QOL to any significant extent. Cocaine, amphetamine, and psilocybin had been used by 1.2 to 3.3% of the population and this varied with QOL to a clear albeit small extent. LSD has been used by 1.2% of the population and the users had a QOL score 10% lower than those who had never used psychotropic drugs. The group with the lowest quality of life was found to be persons who had used heroin, morphine, methadone, and a mixture of alcohol and tranquilizers (10-20% below the group with the highest quality of life).

N2  - Psilocin and psilocybin are psychoactive components of mushrooms of the genus Psilocybe and many others (Panaeolus, Inocybe, Pluteus etc.). In our republic, several species of Psilocybe with a high content of these components can be found. In the present study, we give a semiquantitative content of psilocin and psilocybin in some of our mushrooms in dry substance (Psilocybe semilanceata, Psilocybe bohemica, Psilocybe arcana, Psilocybe cyanescens, Panaeolus acuminatus sensu Ricken, Inocybe haemacta and Pluteus salicinus). For quantification, the GC/MS instrumentation was applied. Psilocin and psilocybin were silylated by the derivatization agent N-methyl-N-trimet-hylsilyltrifluoroacetamide. As an internal standard, 5-methoxytryptamin was used. The results of this study prove the presence of at least three species of Psilocybe with a high content of psychoactive components growing in our republic: Psilocybe semilanceata, Psilocybe bohemica and Psilocybe arcana.

T1  - Hallucinogens: An update
A1  - Halpern J.H. 
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Research of hallucinogen abuse rarely extends beyond epidemiology and observed pathology. Even less research has been completed on the special circumstances surrounding the religious use of hallucinogens or on potential therapeutic applications. Rather than offer another basic review on the well-known hazards of illicit hallucinogen use, this paper provides an overview and practice recommendations on compounds the clinician may be less familiar with, such as the botanical plant Salvio divinorum, the drug 3,4-methylene-dioxymethamphetamine (" ecstasy") and synthetic hallucinogen analogs. The often-warned, but rarely occurring, hazard of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder ("flashbacks") is also reviewed with treatment recommendations provided. The current status of clinical research with the hallucinogens is presented, with case vignettes suggesting hallucinogens may have anti-addictive applications. The special circumstances surrounding the religious, nondrug use of hallucinogens as sacred sacraments in the US and elsewhere are also presented. It is hoped that the reader will gain a more nuanced understanding of how these physiologically nonaddictive drugs may offer legitimate benefits in modern society. By appreciating that such benefits may one day be borne out by careful, methodologically sound research, clinicians should be better armed in raising the topic of hallucinogen use and abuse with their patients.

N2  - Previously the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine was shown to disrupt generation of the auditory event-related potential (ERP) mismatch negativity (MMN) and the performance of an 'AX'-type continuous performance test (AX-CPT)--measures of auditory and visual context-dependent information processing--in a similar manner as observed in schizophrenia. This placebo-controlled study investigated effects of the 5-HT(2A) receptor agonist psilocybin on the same measures in 18 healthy volunteers. Psilocybin administration induced significant performance deficits in the AX-CPT, but failed to reduce MMN generation significantly. These results indirectly support evidence that deficient MMN generation in schizophrenia may be a relatively distinct manifestation of deficient NMDAR functioning. In contrast, secondary pharmacological effects shared by NMDAR antagonists and the 5-HT(2A) agonist (ie disruption of glutamatergic neurotransmission) may be the mechanism underlying impairments in AX-CPT performance observed during both psilocybin and ketamine administration. Comparable deficits in schizophrenia may result from independent dysfunctions of 5-HT(2A) and NMDAR-related neurotransmission.

N2  - Introduction. A wide range of fungi and medicinal herbs, rich in hallucinogenic substances and widely used for mystic and medicinal purposes, can give rise to neurotoxic symptoms. Development. We review the toxic syndromes that can arise from the ingestion of hallucinogenic fungi, cacti and plants, together with descriptions of cases of acute poisoning resulting from the use of medicinal herbs and from foodstuffs that are contaminated by mycotoxins. A series of different psychedelic fungi belonging to the Psilocybe, Panacolus and Stropharia genera contain hallucinogenic alkaloids such as psilocybin. Some of the most notable plants displaying hallucinogenic and sedative properties are Papaver somniferum, Erytroxylum sp. and Cannabis sativa. Infusions of ayahuasca are obtained from the lianas and roots of different plants with psychoactive properties, such as Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, which contain alkaloids derived from tryptamine and from the beta-carboline harmala. Peyote, a cactus rich in mescaline, and Claviceps purpurea (a fungus rich in LSD) are strong hallucinogens. We also examine ergotism and mycotoxicosis from Arthrinium sp. Poisoning from mycotoxin-containing moulds on sugar cane can give rise to encephalopathy and late dystonia. Some of the more noteworthy medicinal plants for which neurological toxicity has been reported are Hypericum perforatum, kava-kava (Piper methysticum), Aconitum sp. and Callilepis laureola. Conclusions. Because of the increasingly more widespread consumption of herbs and fungi and their potentially neurotoxic effects, in clinical practice there is a need to be aware of the neurological syndromes deriving from their use.

T1  - Temporal organization of the brain: Neurocognitive mechanisms and clinical implications
A1  - Dawson K.A. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The synchrony between the individual brain and its environment is maintained by a system of internal clocks that together reflect the temporal organization of the organism. Extending the theoretical work of Edelman and others, the temporal organization of the brain is posited as functioning through "re-entry" and "temporal tagging" and binds the wide range of possible times to a unified cognitive experience which is held in unison with the outside world. Dysfunction in this system is reflected in the temporal discord seen in cases of aging, sleep disorder, jet-lag, and shift-work, as well as in mental disorders and drug-induced changes in consciousness. The extent to which neuroendocrine structures contribute to the neurocognitive mechanisms which underlie consciousness has so far not been explored. Therefore, neuroendocrine mechanisms contributing to the temporal organization of the brain are reviewed. It is concluded that time - and its neuroendocrine correlate melatonin - is a binding principle for organizing conscious experience. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Recreational Ecstasy/MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) users often take a variety of psychoactive drugs, but there is little empirical data on how these drug consumption patterns change with greater experience of Ecstasy. The aim of this study was to compare the polydrug usage patterns reported by non-Ecstasy users, novice Ecstasy users, moderate Ecstasy users, and heavy Ecstasy users. In a WWW study of 763 unpaid volunteers, 481 had never taken Ecstasy, whereas 282 reported they had taken it. The Ecstasy users comprised 109 novice users (1-9 occasions), 136 moderate Ecstasy users (10-99 occasions), and 36 heavy Ecstasy users (+100 occasions). Each participant also reported their experience with a range of other psychoactive drugs. The Ecstasy users reported significantly greater psychoactive drug usage than the non-Ecstasy users. The novice, moderate, and heavy Ecstasy users also differed significantly from each other in the use of cocaine, amphetamine, LSD, and psilocybin mushrooms, but not of alcohol, cannabis, or cigarettes/nicotine. Experienced Ecstasy users also took significantly more MDMA tablets on each occasion, and reported a higher maximum weekly intake. The increased use of Ecstasy is associated with more intensive patterns of Ecstasy/MDMA intake, and the greater use of illicit CNS stimulants and hallucinogens, but not of alcohol, nicotine, or cannabis. These results are discussed in the context of cross-tolerance and drug predisposition/preference. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Relatively few studies have assessed the reinforcing effects of hallucinogenic compounds, and no such studies have attempted to engender contingent responding for these compounds in animals with behavioral histories that include experience with serotonergically mediated reinforcing effects. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the capacity of several hallucinogenic compounds to maintain self-administration behavior in rhesus monkeys with a previous history of 3,4-methylene-dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) self-administration, and to compare these effects across a range of doses of drugs from two structural classes (indolealkylamines and phenylisopropylamines). The results indicate that no compound generated reliable responding and that no subject ever self-administered 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenylisopropylamine (DOI) at rates above those engendered by contingent saline. However, 3 out of 4 subjects did respond at rates between 0.75 and 3.0 responses/s in one or more sessions where N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), mescaline or psilocybin were available. During some of these sessions in which self-administration was maintained, animals earned a majority of all available infusions and appeared intoxicated by the end of the session. This pattern of transient self-administration may indicate that these compounds have weak reinforcing effects, or mixed reinforcing and aversive effects. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - The aim of this study was the analysis of mushroom poisonings (MP) in children in Central Anatolia. Casesyounger than 18y-of-age, who presented and were diagnosed as MP between January 1991 and December 2002 were evaluated for gender, age, presenting month, city of residence, first noticed symptoms, vital signs, laboratory studies, hospitalization period and outcome. Sixty-four cases were enrolled; 36 were female (56.3%). The mean age was 8.6y. May and June were the most common presenting months, with 46 cases (71.8%); 61 cases (95.3%) were poisoned by wild mushrooms (WM). The most common first noticed symptoms were from the gastroinal system (GIS) (70.6%); 67.2% of cases presented to second level health centers when the first symptoms started; 92.2% were admitted to the hospital. Mean hospitalization period was 2.8 d. Five cases (7.8%) had a fatal outcome. All the fatal cases were from WM poisoning and from the same city. Their first noticed symptoms were GIS symptoms. All fatal cases had delayed presentations. Cultivated MP did not result in bad outcomes in the pediatric age group. WM were the main source of MP in children in our region in Turkey. Education of the public about consuming mushrooms, and health personnel working in health centers for early treatment and transfer to the appropriate facility are important to decrease mortality.

N2  - Objective: Recent functional imaging studies have reported evidence of alterations in the serotonergic system induced by 3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), or "Ecstasy." However, these studies have often been limited by small sample size, lack of tracer selectivity, unreliable assessment of MDMA doses, insufficiently matched comparison groups, or region-of-interest analysis. Method: Positron emission tomography (PET) using the specific serotonin transporter ligand [ 11C](+)McN5652 was performed in 117 subjects: 30 current MDMA users, 29 former MDMA users, 29 drug-naive comparison subjects, and 29 users of drugs other than MDMA (polydrug comparison subjects). Self-assessment of drug history was checked by analyzing hair samples. Local serotonin transporter availability was computed by a regularized reference tissue approach. Voxel-based comparison of serotonin transporter availability was performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM 99). Results: Serotonin transporter availability in current MDMA users was significantly reduced in the mesencephalon, thalamus, left caudate, hippocampus, occipital cortex, temporal lobes, and posterior cingulate gyrus compared with all other groups. Reduction was more pronounced in female than in male subjects. There was no significant difference of serotonin transporter availability among former MDMA users and the drug-naive and polydrug comparison subjects. A negative correlation between serotonin transporter availability and mean MDMA dose was found in occipital visual areas and in the left precentral sulcus of current MDMA users. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the serotonin transporter availability and the MDMA abstention period in brainstem and in the basal forebrain in all MDMA users. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis of MDMA-induced protracted alterations of the serotonergic system and indicate that the reduced availability of serotonin transporter, as measured by PET, might be reversible. Women appear to be more susceptible than men to MDMA-induced alterations of the serotonergic system.

N2  - One hundred residents undergoing treatment for severe drug an/or alcohol addiction were asked to complete Robson's self-esteem questionnaire at the time of admission. Follow-up was obtained from sixty-eight residents six months later. The group average score was 101.8 on admission and at follow-up was 148.3. The results show considerable positive gains in self-esteem over time from an initial level which fell two standard deviations below the normal mean score to a level within the normal range. The group average score of a small control group remained stable over a four month non-treatment period. The findings suggest that significant improvement in self-esteem occurs in Ley Community residents undergoing treatment which would not have occurred in the absence of therapy. © The Authors.

N2  - Rationale: Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptors play an important role in perception, affect regulation and attention. Pharmacological challenge with the 5-HT2A agonist psilocybin (PY) is useful in studying the neurobiological basis of cognition and consciousness. Objective: Investigation of dose-dependent effects of PY on psycho(patho)logical and physiological parameters. Methods: Eight subjects received placebo (PL), and 45 ("very low dose, VLD"), 115 ("low dose, LD"), 215 ("medium dose, MD"), and 315 ("high dose, HD") mug/kg body weight PY. The "Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale" (5D-ASC), the "Frankfurt Attention Inventory" (FAIR), and the "Adjective Mood Rating Scale" (AMRS) were used to assess the effects of PY on psycho(patho)logical core dimensions, attention, and mood. A 24-h electrocardiogram (EKG) was recorded and blood pressure was measured. Plasma concentrations of thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin (PRL), cortisol (CORT), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and standard clinical chemical parameters were determined. Results: PY dose dependently increased scores of all 5D-ASC core dimensions. Only one subject reacted with transient anxiety to HD PY. Compared with PL, MD and HD PY led to a 50% reduction of performance in the FAIR test. "General inactivation", "emotional excitability", and "dreaminess" were the only domains of the AMRS showing increased scores following MD and HD PY. The mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was moderately elevated only 60 min following administration of HD PY. Neither EKG nor body temperature was affected by any dose of PY, TSH, ACTH, and CORT plasma levels were elevated during peak effects of HD PY, whereas PRL plasma levels were increased following MD and HD PY. Conclusion: PY affects core dimensions of altered states of consciousness and physiological parameters in a dose-dependent manner. Our study provided no cause for concern that PY is hazardous with respect to somatic health.

T1  - Forensic analysis of hallucinogenic fungi: A DNA-based approach
A1  - Nugent K.G.
A1  - Saville B.J. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Hallucinogenic fungi synthesize two controlled substances, psilocin and psilocybin. Possession of the fungal species that contain these compounds is a criminal offence in North America. Some related species that are morphologically similar, do not contain the controlled substances. Therefore, unambiguous identification of fungi to the species level is critical in determining if a mushroom is illegal. We investigate a phylogenetic approach for the identification of species that contain the psychoactive compounds. We analyzed 35 North American specimens representing seven different genera of hallucinogenic and non-hallucinogenic mushrooms. We amplified and sequenced the internal transcribed spacer region of the rDNA (ITS-1) and a 5' portion of the nuclear large ribosomal subunit of rRNA (nLSU rRNA or 28S). ITS-1 locus sequence data was highly variable and produced a phylogenetic resolution that was not consistent with morphological identifications. In contrast, the nLSU rRNA data clustered isolates from the same species and separated hallucinogen containing and non-hallucinogen containing isolates into distinct clades. With this information, we propose an approach that combines the specificity of PCR detection and the resolving power of phylogenetic analysis to efficiently and unambiguously identify hallucinogenic fungal specimens for legal purposes. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - Hallucinogens

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Hallucinogens (psychedelics) are psychoactive substances that powerfully alter perception, mood, and a host of cognitive processes. They are considered physiologically safe and do not produce dependence or addiction. Their origin predates written history, and they were employed by early cultures in a variety of sociocultural and ritual contexts. In the 1950s, after the virtually contemporaneous discovery of both serotonin (5-HT) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25), early brain research focused intensely on the possibility that LSD or other hallucinogens had a serotonergic basis of action and reinforced the idea that 5-HT was an important neurotransmitter in brain. These ideas were eventually proven, and today it is believed that hallucinogens stimulate 5-HT2A receptors, especially those expressed on neocortical pyramidal cells. Activation of 5-HT2A receptors also leads to increased cortical glutamate levels presumably by a presynaptic receptor-mediated release from thalamic afferents. These findings have led to comparisons of the effects of classical hallucinogens with certain aspects of acute psychosis and to a focus on thalamocortical interactions as key to understanding both the action of these substances and the neuroanatomical sites involved in altered states of consciousness (ASC). In vivo brain imaging in humans using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose has shown that hallucinogens increase prefrontal cortical metabolism, and correlations have been developed between activity in specific brain areas and psychological elements of the ASC produced by hallucinogens. The 5-HT2A receptor clearly plays an essential role in cognitive processing, including working memory, and ligands for this receptor may be extremely useful tools for future cognitive neuroscience research. In addition, it appears entirely possible that utility may still emerge for the use of hallucinogens in treating alcoholism, substance abuse, and certain psychiatric disorders. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The use of MDMA/Ecstasy has increased among young people in many industrialised nations around the world since the mid-1990s. Although there is a lack of scientific consensus concerning the long-term consequences of Ecstasy use, reducing potential morbidity and mortality is an important public health concern. This article describes how young people characterise perceived long-term consequences associated with Ecstasy using three data sources: (1) qualitative interviews with 29 participants; (2) pile sort results from 20 participants who classified 15 psychoactive substances on the basis of perceived similarities; and (3) quantitative data on subjective memory impairment from 402 participants in our natural history study. Contrary to expectations, Ecstasy was classified midway between drugs perceived to be the most and least risky. Risks associated with Ecstasy use included two popular myths implying forms of brain damage - "draining spinal fluid" and "creating holes in brains". Qualitative results also indicated that some young people are concerned about the potential affects of the drug on memory and as a cause of depression. About 20% (82) of the participants (n=402) "agreed" or "strongly agreed" that Ecstasy has impaired their memories. Concern about these adverse consequences may provide opportunities for reducing potential harm associated with Ecstasy use. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - In the past several years, the use of MDMA (Ecstasy) has increased substantially in the United States and in many countries around the world. Although this increase has been associated with the dance club and rave scenes, Ecstasy use has expanded into new settings. At the same time, the diversity of people using the drug has also grown. Given the increasing, although unclear, evidence that MDMA has the potential to cause neurotoxicity and various psychological problems under certain conditions among humans, understanding how active users perceive the risks associated with Ecstasy use can help to inform prevention and intervention approaches. Based on audiotaped focus groups and individual interviews conducted with 30 Ecstasy users in Dayton and Columbus, Ohio, this article explores these and other issues. Results demonstrate that beyond the risk of obtaining something potentially deadly instead of MDMA, most users do not associate risks of neurotoxicity or psychological problems with Ecstasy use. Active users look to harm-reduction approaches for answers to using Ecstasy safely; prevention messages like, "just say no to drugs" are largely ignored. Because Ecstasy is commonly used among small groups of friends, peer leader or other social network intervention approaches may be promising.

N2  - Mushroom poisoning is caused by the consumption of raw or cooked mushrooms. Mushroom toxins are generally evaluated in eight categories.. These toxins are known as amatoxins, hydrazines, orellanine, ibotenic acid, muscimol, muscarine, psilocybin and coprine. The main symptoms are varied according to the toxins and categorized in five types. These symptoms are related to protoplasmic poisonings (symptoms such as; severe seizures of abdominal pain, persistent vomiting and watery diarrhea, extreme thirst, and lack of urine production occuring acutely at the end of the latent period), neurotoxins (depression, constipation, passion, hallucination, coma and sweating), gastrointestinal irritants (vomiting and/or diarrhea for a few days), disulfiram-like poisoning (a complicating factor in this type of intoxication is that this causative species is generally considered edible. No adverse effects occur unless ingested with alcoholic beverages) and miscellaneous poisonings (digestive upsets in adults and visual hallucinations and ataxia in children). Mushroom poisonings are generally acute and progressive. All humans are susceptible to mushroom toxins. Children are more sensitive towards toxins than adults and more likely suffer from ingestion of low doses. It is predicted that approximately 100 mushroom poisoning cases annually occur in Turkey.

N2  - Objective: This paper describes two cases with khat- and two with psilocybin-induced psychoses and draws attention to the medical and social consequences of the use of these drugs. Method: Two male patients are presented who developed relapsing and short-lasting psychotic episodes after chewing kath leaves. In addition, two male patients are reported who showed an acute exacerbation of psychosis after ingestion of psilocybin mushrooms. In addition, a review of the literature is presented. Results: The khat-induced psychotic symptoms disappeared without any treatment within one week. One of the patients with a psilocybin-induced psychosis was treated with risperidone. In the other, symptomatology subsided in a few days. No somatic medical complications occurred. Conclusion: Adequate psychiatric diagnosis and treatment of the psychoses and the negative social consequences of the use of these drugs are stressed as well as the delineation from functional psychoses in cases of chronic use. The latter applies to patients with psychiatric comorbidity in particular.

N2  - The sensitive determination of psilocin was carried out by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with fluorimetry (FL) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Psilocin and bufotenine, used as an internal standard (IS), were labeled with excess amounts of 4-(N,N- dimethylaminosulfonyl)-7-(2-chloroformylpyrrolidin-1-yl)-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (DBD-Pro-COCl) at 60degreeC for 10 min in the presence of pyridine as the scavenger of HCl produced in the solution. The resulting derivatives were separated by a Mightysil RP-18 GP column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, i.d., 3 mum) with an acidic mobile-phase containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and detected at 560 nm (excitation at 440 nm). Under the conditions for derivatization, separation and detection, a good linearity of the calibration curve of psilocin was observed by the HPLC-FL method. On the other hand, the derivative, separated by a Mightysil RP-18 GP (100 mm x 2.0 mm, i.d., 3 mum) using 50 mM AcONH4-CH3CN (73:27), was also determined by HPLC-ESI-MS. The mass spectrometer was operated in the selected-ion monitoring (SIM) mode for the protonated-molecular ion [M + H] + (m/z = 527). The calibration curve in the SIM mode was also linear in the range of 0.16-4.08 ng psilocin, similar to the HPLC-FL method. The coefficient of variation (CV) was 5.15% (0.16 ng injection, n = 6). The quantitation limit was 0.64 ng/mg dried mushroom. The amounts of psilocin in six magic mushrooms using HPLC-MS were lower than 12.67 ng/mg samples. The developed method was also successfully applied to the determination of psilocin in rat plasma after a single i.p. administration of psilocybin. The proposed method provides good precision and trace detection of psilocin in actual samples, suggesting that these analytical techniques are usable for the determination of psilocin in various specimens. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Hallucinogens and dissociative agents naturally growing in the United States
A1  - Halpern J.H. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - It is usually believed that drugs of abuse are smuggled into the United States or are clandestinely produced for illicit distribution. Less well known is that many hallucinogens and dissociative agents can be obtained from plants and fungi growing wild or in gardens. Some of these botanical sources can be located throughout the United States; others have a more narrow distribution. This article reviews plants containing N,N-dimethyltryptamine, reversible type A monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), lysergic acid amide, the anticholinergic drugs atropine and scopolamine, or the diterpene salvinorin-A (Salvia divinorum). Also reviewed are mescaline-containing cacti, psilocybin/psilocin- containing mushrooms, and the Amanita muscaria and Amanita pantherina mushrooms that contain muscimol and ibotenic acid. Dangerous misidentification is most common with the mushrooms, but even a novice forager can quickly learn how to properly identify and prepare for ingestion many of these plants. Moreover, through the ever-expanding dissemination of information via the Internet, this knowledge is being obtained and acted upon by more and more individuals. This general overview includes information on the geographical range, drug content, preparation, intoxication, and the special health risks associated with some of these plants. Information is also offered on the unique issue of when bona fide religions use such plants as sacraments in the United States. In addition to the Native American Church's (NAC) longstanding right to peyote, two religions of Brazilian origin, the Santo Daime and the Uniao do Vegetal (UDV), are seeking legal protection in the United States for their use of sacramental dimethyltryptamine-containing "ayahuasca." © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The cultivation or trafficking of "Magic mushrooms," containing hallucinogenic psilocin and psilocybin, has been prohibited by the Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law in Japan since 2002. To identify these mushrooms, we attempted to prepare the monoclonal antibody (mAb) reactive to these hallucinogens. As an antigen inducing an anti-psilocin mAb, N-{4-[3-(2- dimethylaminoethyl)indol-4-yl-oxy]butyl} succinamic acid was synthesized by modifying the 4-hydroxyl moiety of psilocin and coupled to a carrier protein of keyhole limpet hemocyanin. BALB/c mice were immunized five times with the antigen emulsified with an adjuvant, and their spleen cells were fused with mouse myeloma cells. We obtained several hybridoma cells producing mAbs reactive to psilocin, from which four clones, BA631, CA231, KA422, and MA332 with a higher production of anti-psilocin mAb were selected by limiting dilution. Isotype of CA231 and KA422 mAbs were IgG2a and that of BA631 and MA332 mAbs were IgG1. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using BA631 mAb, revealed that BA631 cross-reacted with psilocin and dimethyltryptamine, but not with the other indole derivatives such as psilocybin, 4-hydroxyindole, tryptamine, and tryptophan. Therefore, these antibodies could be used for the identification of magic mushrooms.

T1  - Depersonalisation disorder: A contemporary overview
A1  - Simeon D. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Depersonalisation disorder is characterised by prominent depersonalisation and often derealisation, without clinically notable memory or identity disturbances. The disorder has an approximately 1:1 gender ratio with onset at around 16 years of age. The course of the disorder is typically long term and often continuous. Mood, anxiety and personality disorders are often comorbid with depersonalisation disorder but none predict symptom severity. The most common immediate precipitants of the disorder are severe stress, depression and panic, and marijuana and hallucinogen ingestion. Depersonalisation disorder has also been associated with childhood interpersonal trauma, in particular emotional maltreatment. Neurochemical findings have suggested possible involvement of serotonergic, endogenous opioid and glutamatergic NMDA pathways. Brain imaging studies in depersonalisation disorder have revealed widespread alterations in metabolic activity in the sensory association cortex, as well as prefrontal hyperactivation and limbic inhibition in response to aversive stimuli. Depersonalisation disorder has also been associated with autonomic blunting and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation. To date, treatment recommendations and guidelines for depersonalisation disorder have not been established. There are few studies assessing the use of pharmacotherapy in this disorder. Medication options that have been reported include clomipramine, fluoxetine, lamotrigine and opioid antagonists. However, it does not appear that any of these agents have a potent anti-dissociative effect A variety of psychotherapeutic techniques has been used to treat depersonalisation disorder (including trauma-focused therapy and cognitive-behavioural techniques), although again none of these have established efficacy to date. Overall, novel therapeutic approaches are clearly needed to help individuals experiencing this refractory disorder.

T1  - Czech drug laws as an arena of the drug policy battle
A1  - Zabransky T. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - This paper begins with a brief overview Czech drug policy and drug-related issues. The second section concentrates on how that policy has evolved since the fall of communism, identifies the main players in these events, and provides some details about the legislative procedure that eventually led to the reintroduction of punishments for the possession of illegal drugs. The paper describes in broad terms a major scientific evaluation of the impacts of recent legislative changes and subsequent government reactions to that report. Recent developments in the Czech drug policy debate are addressed in the third section of the paper. This account focuses on the ongoing legislative debate over whether the possession of drugs for personal use should be a criminal offense (this issue has been contested for nearly 10 years). Finally, a controversial legislative proposal that was only recently issued by the Ministry of Justice will be described.

N2  - The hallucinogenic serotonin1A&2A agonist psilocybin is known for its ability to induce illusions of motion in otherwise stationary objects or textured surfaces. This study investigated the effect of psilocybin on local and global motion processing in nine human volunteers. Using a forced choice direction of motion discrimination task we show that psilocybin selectively impairs coherence sensitivity for random dot patterns, likely mediated by high-level global motion detectors, but not contrast sensitivity for drifting gratings, believed to be mediated by low-level detectors. These results are in line with those observed within schizophrenic populations and are discussed in respect to the proposition that psilocybin may provide a model to investigate clinical psychosis and the pharmacological underpinnings of visual perception in normal populations. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

T1  - Capillary electrophoresis analysis of a wide variety of seized drugs using the same capillary with dynamic coatings

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Capillary electrophoresis methodology is presented for the routine analysis of a wide variety of seized drugs using the same capillary with dynamic coatings and multiple run buffers. The types of exhibits analyzed using diode array UV detection include phenethylamines, cocaine, oxycodone, heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), opium, hallucinogenic mushrooms, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate-gamma-butyrolactone (GHB-GBL). Both qualitative and quantitative analyses are achieved using run buffers that contain additives that provide for secondary equilibrium and/or dynamic coating of the capillary. Dynamic coating of the capillary surface is accomplished by rapid flushes of 0.1 N sodium hydroxide, water, buffer containing polycation coating reagent, and a buffer containing a polyanionic coating reagent (with or without cyclodextrin(s)) or a micelle coating reagent. Dynamic coating with a polyanionic coating reagent is used for the analysis of moderately basic seized drugs and adulterants. The use of cyclodextrin in the run buffer not only allows for chiral analysis but also greatly enhances separation selectivity for achiral solutes. A capillary dynamically coated with a micelle allows for the analysis of neutral, acidic, and weakly basic drugs (GHB, GBL and neutral, acidic, and weakly basic adulterants). Dynamic coating, which gives rise to a relatively high and robust electroosmotic flow at pH < 7, allows for rapid, precise and reproducible separations. For a wide variety of drugs, excellent linearity and migration time precision and good peak area precision (external and internal standard) is obtained. Quantitative results for synthetic mixtures are in good agreement with actual values. Screening for adulterants is greatly enhanced by the use of automated library searches. © 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

N2  - Behrendt & Young's (B&Y's) novel "unifying model" of hallucinations, although comprehensive, fails to incorporate research into the possible role of 5-HT2A receptors in the mode of action of novel "atypical" antipsychotic drugs (which treat hallucinations effectively), and into the role of such receptors, which are located in thalamocortical circuits, in mediating drug-induced hallucinations.

T1  - Molecular and cellular mechanisms for the polarized sorting of serotonin receptors: Relevance for genesis and treatment of psychosis
A1  - Roth B.L.
A1  - Xia Z. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The 5-HT2A serotonin receptor represents the principal molecular target for the actions of both classic hallucinogens, which function as agonists, and atypical antipsychotic drugs, which function as inverse agonists. Pharmacological agents that modify the activity of 5-HT2A receptors are known to modulate human perception and cognition. 5-HT2A receptors are found predominantly in the apical dendritic segment and dendritic spines of cortical pyramidal neurons. This review discusses our current understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing the preferential targeting of 5-HT2A receptors to apical dendrites and dendritic spines. Uncovering the processes responsible for the polarization of 5-HT2A receptors to neuronal subdomains will likely provide crucial insights into the modulating mechanisms that can affect human cognition and perception. © 2004 by Begell House, Inc.

T1  - Comparison of acute lethal toxicity of commonly abused psychoactive substances
A1  - Gable R.S. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Aims: To determine the acute lethal toxicity of a range of psychoactive substances in terms of the dose customarily used as a single substance for non-medical purposes. Design and method: A structured English-language literature search was conducted to identify experimental studies and clinical reports that documented human and non-human lethal doses of 20 abused substances that are distributed widely in Europe and North America. Four inclusion criteria were specified for the reports, and approximately 3000 relevant records were retrieved from search engines at Biosis, Science Citation Index, Google and the National Library of Medicine's Gateway. In order to account for different drug potencies, a 'safety ratio' was computed for each substance by comparing its reported acute lethal dose with the dose most commonly used for non-medical purposes. Findings: The majority of published reports of acute lethal toxicity indicate that the decedent used a co-intoxicant (most often alcohol). The calculated safety ratios varied between substances by more than a factor of 100. Intravenous heroin appeared to have the greatest direct physiological toxicity; several hallucinogens appeared to have the least direct physiological toxicity. Conclusions: Despite residual uncertainties, the substantial difference in safety ratios suggests that abused substances can be rank-ordered on the basis of their potential acute lethality.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The assessment procedure of new synthetic illicit drugs that are not documented in the UN treaty on psychotropic drugs was evaluated using a modified Electre model. Drugs were evaluated by an expert panel via the open Delphi approach, where the written score was discussed on 16 items, covering medical, health, legal, and criminalistic issues of the drugs. After this face-to-face discussion the drugs were scored again. Taking the assessment of ketamine as an example, it appeared that each expert used its own scale to score, and that policymakers do not score deviant from experts trained in the medical-biological field. Of the five drugs evaluated by the panel, p-methoxy-metamphetamine (PMMA), gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and 4-methylthio-amphetamine (MTA) were assessed as more adverse than ketamine and psilocine and psilocybine-containing mushrooms. Whereas some experts slightly adjusted during the assessment procedure their opinion on ketamine and PMMA, the opinion on mushrooms was not affected by the discussion held between the two scoring rounds. All experts rank the five drugs in a similar way on the adverse effect scale i.e., concordance scale of the Electre model, indicating unanimity in the expert panel with respect to the risk classification of these abused drugs. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - In this chapter we have studied the pharmacological properties from the main so-called "club drugs". We have divided these drugs into 2 groups: "designer drugs" and hallucinogen drugs. "Designer drugs" (term coined by G Henderson) include: phenylethylamines such as MDMA ("ecstasy"), opioids such as meperidine and fentanyl derivatives, phencyclidine (PCP), metaqualone-like compounds and other drugs such as gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB). MDMA (3-4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is a synthetic, psychoactive drug with both stimulant and hallucinogenic properties which might produce neurotoxicity. GHB and ketamine are predominantly central nervous system depressants. GHB, ketamine and flunitrazepam (a classic benzodiazepine) constitute a new class of drugs called "date rape drugs" since they are often colorless, tasteless, odorless and they can incapacitate victims and prevent them from resisting sexual assault. LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is the most potent hallucinogenic drug and produces significant psychodelic effects.

N2  - In order to develop a sensitive and reliable analytical method for psilocin (PC) in urine samples, the hydrolysis conditions including the acid, alkaline and enzymatic hydrolyses have been investigated by monitoring not only PC but also psilocin glucuronide (PCG) by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS); PCG was initially identified in a "magic mushroom (MM)" user's urine by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and LC-MS-MS. The proposed conditions optimized for the hydrolysis are as follows: hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis; enzyme, Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase (5000units/ml urine); incubation, pH 6 at 37degreeC for 2h. The complete hydrolysis of PCG in urine was obtained under these conditions, while the enzymatic hydrolyses with three types of beta-glucuronidases originated from bovine liver (Type B-1), Helix pomatia (Type H-1) and Ampullaria provided uncompleted hydrolysis of PCG. Also, neither the acid nor alkaline hydrolysis was found to be applicable. According to the present method, 3.55mug/ml of psilocin was detected in the "magic mushroom" user's urine after the enzymatic hydrolysis, though psilocin was not detected without hydrolysis. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Implementation of regulations to control the prescribing of benzodiazepines in New York State in 1989 resulted in a 55% decrease in benzodiazepine prescribing, with a concomitant increase in the rates of prescribing older sedative-hypnotic compounds such as butabarbital (30% increase) and meprobamate (125% increase). In a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study, we compared the behavioral and pharmacological effects of triazolam, meprobamate, and butabarbital in 14 recreational drug users. Placebo and three doses each of triazolam, meprobamate, and butabarbital were administered to each subject in a random order. Objective tests (motor performance, concentration) and subjective response questionnaires measured drug effects. Triazolam, meprobamate, and butabarbital showed comparable negative dose-response slopes on the objective measures. On the basis of these objective data, equivalent doses for the three compounds were determined to be as follows: 0.5 mg triazolam = 2,400 mg meprobamate = 400 mg butabarbital. Subjective effects data on equivalent doses show that butabarbital produced the highest peak score on Cole/ARCI Abuse Potential, ARCI Pentobarbital Chlorpromazine Alcohol Group (PCAG), and "drug strength" scales. Triazolam and butabarbital produced equivalent results on ARCI Morphine Benzedrine Group (MBG), Cole/ARCI Euphoria, and "drug liking" scales. Meprobamate was indistinguishable from placebo on euphoria and abuse potential scales. Behavioral economics analysis indicated a price crossover point two times higher for butabarbital (400 mg) than for any other drug condition. These data indicate a comparative abuse liability of butabarbital > triazolam >= meprobamate, suggesting that the prescribing restrictions on benzodiazepines had little net benefit on abuse risk in the population and may have increased the risk of overdose morbidity and mortality.

N2  - The concise large-scale syntheses of psilocin (1) and psilocybin (2), the principal hallucinogenic constituents of "magic mushroom", were achieved without chromatographic purification. The key step in the synthesis of 2 was the isolation of the dibenzyl-protected intermediate (7) as a zwitterionic derivative (8), which was completely identified by means of 2D NMR analyses.

N2  - Morphological and toxicological analyses were performed on hallucinogenic mushrooms that are currently circulated in Japan. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) indicated a three-dimensional microstructures in the mushrooms. The complementary use of SEM with an optical microscope was effective for observing characteristic tissues, such as basidiomycetes, spores, cystidia and basidia. Hallucinogenic alkaloids were extracted with methanol and determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a UV detector set at 220nm. The psilocin/psilocybin contents in Psilocybe cubensis were in the range of 0.14-0.42%/0.37-1.30% in the whole mushroom (0.17-0.78%/0.44-1.35% in the cap and 0.09-0.30%/0.05-1.27% in the stem), respectively. The hallucinogenic alkaloids in Copelandia were 0.43-0.76%/0.08-0.22% in the whole mushroom (0.64-0.74%/0.02-0.22% in the cap and 0.31-0.78%/0.01-0.39% in the stem). It thus appears that P. cubensis is psilocybin-rich, whereas Copelandia is psilocin-rich. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - A fast liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometric (LC-ESI-MS-MS) method by using a monolithic column, gradient elution and ion trap mass spectrometer was developed for 14 forensically interesting and chemically different compounds. All compounds were eluted within 2.5 min and the total analysis time was 5 min including stabilisation time required for the next injection. All the compounds, basics, neutrals and acids were efficiently ionised by positive ion ESI. A laboratory library including MS-MS spectra and retention times was developed and tested. Results with 476 standard samples and 50 authentic samples showed that the compounds studied can be unambiguously identified with the library. A quantitative method was developed for the compounds using external calibration. The evaluation process showed good linearity of the method and reasonable repeatability. Limits of detection ranged from 10.0 to 50.0 ng/ml. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - 'Magic mushrooms' (MMs) are psychoactive fungi containing the hallucinogenic compounds, psilocin (1) and psilocybin (2). Since June 6, 2002, these fungi have been regulated by the Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law in Japan. Because there are many kinds of MMs and they are sold even as dry powders in local markets, it is very difficult to identify the original species of the MMs by morphological observation. Therefore, we investigated the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region in the ribosomal RNA gene of MMs obtained in Japanese markets to classify them by a genetic approach. Based on the size and nucleotide sequence of the ITS region amplified by PCR, tested MMs were classified into 6 groups. Furthermore, a comparison of the DNA sequences of the MMs with those of authentic samples or with those found in the databases (GenBank, EMBL and DDBJ) made it possible to identify the species of tested MMs. Analysis by LC revealed that psilocin (1) was contained at the highest level in Panaeolus cyanescens among the MMs, but was absent in the Amanita species.

N2  - MDMA ("Ecstasy") and its analogues such as MDE and MDA are amphetamine derivatives reported to produce an altered state with emotional overtones. Since more than ten years, ecstasy is after cannabis the most frequently used recreational drug by young adults, particularly in the so-called techno-scene. However, according to a recent survey there is an increasing trend for a revival of classic amphetamine and hallucinogen abuse, possibly due to the concern about the potential neurotoxicity and somatic risks associated with ecstasy use. Of the hallucinogens consumed, psilocybin containing mushroom ("magic mushrooms"), but also LSD are at the forefront. The present contribution summarizes the psychological and somatic effects of hallucinogens, amphetamines, and entactogens.

N2  - Introduction: It has been accepted that acute toxicity of psilocin is low and this substance does not create a serious health hazard. Few symptoms observed after intake of Psilocybe mushrooms were mostly limited to the Central Nervous System. Material and methods: In order to readdress the supposed low toxicity and relative safety of natural hallucinogens, we performed tests with 52 Wistar male rats, divided into four equal groups. The rats were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of solution (psilocin, phenylethylamine, ethanol, saline), three times per week during 12 weeks period. Electrocardiograms were performed after two and eight weeks of the experiment in 32 randomly selected animals from each group and repeated before the autopsy after 12 weeks in all 52 animals. The ECG was recorded under low-dose ketamine anaesthesia, exactly one hour after injection, using an AsCard B-5 apparatus (50 mm/min, 20 mm/mV). Electrodes were placed on the extremities according to Einthoven and Goldberg and in the precardiac area according to Wilson. Heart rate (beats/min) and QRS complexes were analysed. Results and conclusions: Obtained data indicate that the repeated administration of psilocin in rats produces ECG abnormalities including tachycardia, ST segment alterations, and aberrant intraventricular conduction.

N2  - Principle: The various mushroom poisoning syndromes are summarised together with elements underlining uncertainty and lack of knowledge. For each of the classical syndromes concerned, classified in delays inferior or superior to 6 hours, the toxins and their mechanisms of action, the main mushrooms responsible, the symptoms and their treatment are all presented. Early syndromes: Characterised by early onset within 6 hours, these represent the majority of intoxications. There are 6 syndromes: gastro-intestinal (resinoid), muscarine (sudorien, cholinergic), pantherine (myco-atropine, anticholinergic), coprine (similar to the antabuse syndrome), narcotine (psilocybin, hallucinatory) and paxillus syndrome (exceptional). Late syndromes: Characterised by an onset after six hours, they regroup the phalloid syndrome that is responsible for 90 to 95% of deaths due to higher funghi mushrooms, the orellanine and gyromitrin syndrome and new syndromes identified over the past decade concerning acute renal failure with shorter onset than during the orellanine syndrome (Amanita proxima), erythermalgia (Clitocybe amoenolens), rhabdomyolysis (Tricholoma equestre) and central nervous system failure (Hapalopilus rutilans). © 2003, Masson, Paris.

N2  - Whereas ligand studies can inform the end-products of dysregulation of genetic expression, reporter gene imaging can provide the means to understand the genetic origin of these end-products. As with radioligand studies, in vivo direct measurement of gene expression will allow genetic processes to be monitored over time in the same subject, use of a subject as his/her own control in intervention studies (ie, measurement before and after an intervention), and monitoring the spatial distribution of molecular events in the whole brain. Furthermore, reporter gene imaging, by advancing knowledge of the biologic mechanisms of disease states, has important clinical implications, particularly in the development and monitoring of treatments. We expect PET to play a prominent role in the elucidation of substance abuse mechanisms and contribute significantly to the development of innovative treatment strategies.

N2  - This study was focused on examining the influence of gas flow parameters on capillary electrophoresis/mass spectrometry (CE /MS) performance using sheath-liquid CE /MS interfaces. The effects of nebulizing and drying gas velocity and drying gas temperature on CE separation and MS detection sensitivity were systematically determined. Nebulizing gas velocity was observed to be a critical parameter in the optimization of CE /MS method, since it affected both MS detection sensitivity, and also CE separation efficiency for one interface design tested. Better detection sensitivity was obtained when the nebulizing gas velocity was increased. However, high velocity of the nebulizing gas flow can cause a hydrodynamic bulk flow inside the CE capillary, thus clearly increasing the apparent mobility and decreasing the resolution obtained for the compounds studied. Increasing the drying gas velocity or temperature did not affect the apparent mobility or the separation efficiency and the temperature could be increased to achieve the optimal detection sensitivity in the CE /MS analysis. For comparison, the effects of nebulizing gas flow were studied using a different design of the coaxial sheath-liquid CE /MS interface, and in this case better detection sensitivity but no effect on CE separation efficiency was observed with increased nebulizing gas velocity. These different effects of nebulizing gas flow on the CE bulk flow were concluded to result from pressure differences at the tip of the CE capillaries for the different CE /MS interface arrangements. It is therefore recommended that the cross-sectional dimensions of the fused-silica and steel capillaries, and the gas streamlines, should be optimized when CE /MS interfaces are built. Moreover, the effect of gas flow on CE separation should be studied when optimizing the CE /MS operation parameters. Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - What geometric visual hallucinations tell us about the visual cortex

N2  - Many observers see geometric visual hallucinations after taking hallucinogens such as LSD, cannabis, mescaline or psilocybin; on viewing bright flickering lights; on waking up or falling asleep; in "near-death" experiences; and in many other syndromes. Kluver organized the images into four groups called form constants: (I) tunnels and funnels, (II) spirals, (III) lattices, including honeycombs and triangles, and (IV) cobwebs. In most cases, the images are seen in both eyes and move with them. We interpret this to mean that they are generated in the brain. Here, we summarize a theory of their origin in visual cortex (area V1), based on the assumption that the form of the retino-cortical map and the architecture of V1 determine their geometry. (A much longer and more detailed mathematical version has been published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 356 [2001].) We model V1 as the continuum limit of a lattice of interconnected hypercolumns, each comprising a number of interconnected iso-orientation columns. Based on anatomical evidence, we assume that the lateral connectivity between hypercolumns exhibits symmetries, rendering it invariant under the action of the Euclidean group E(2), composed of reflections and translations in the plane, and a (novel) shift-twist action. Using this symmetry, we show that the various patterns of activity that spontaneously emerge when V1's spatially uniform resting state becomes unstable correspond to the form constants when transformed to the visual field using the retino-cortical map. The results are sensitive to the detailed specification of the lateral connectivity and suggest that the cortical mechanisms that generate geometric visual hallucinations are closely related to those used to process edges, contours, surfaces, and textures.

T1  - 5-HT2A receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the stimulus effects of hallucinogens

N2  - The role of 5-HT2A-mediated stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the discriminative effects of hallucinogens was investigated in PC12 cells stably expressing the rat 5-HT2A receptor (PC12-5-HT2A cells). The hallucinogenic compounds, D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), (-)2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM), psilocybin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (MDMT) and N,N-diethyltryptamine (DET), all caused a concentration-dependent increase in the generation of [3H]inositol phosphates. The nonhallucinogenic compounds, 6-fluoro-N,N-diethyltryptamine (6-F-DET), lisuride and quipazine, also displayed significant efficacy in stimulating phosphoinositide hydrolysis, while 2-bromo-lysergic acid diethylamide (BOL), which is not a hallucinogen, did not alter inositol phosphate generation. The beta-carbolines, harmaline and harmane, also did not alter phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Comparison of these results with previous drug discrimination studies indicated the apparent lack of correlation between the degree of substitution in LSD- and DOM-trained animals and efficacy in stimulating phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The present study indicates that 5-HT2A-mediated stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis does not appear to be the sole critical signaling mechanism involved in the discriminative effects of hallucinogens. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - The action of P. cubensis mushroom extract, containing psilocybin (PCB) and psilocin, on spike activity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons was studied in in vitro rat brain slices. In 38 (76%) out of 50 investigated neurons spike activity was decreased, in 2 (4%) cells it increased. There was no response 10 (20%) neurons. Application of the extract caused short burst firing in 12 (24%) neurons. All neurons showing inhibition during PCB-containing extract application, were also inhibited by serotonin (5-HT). Usually inhibitory reaction did not last over 4-5 min upon 3 min extract application and could be prolonged up to 10-43 min up on serotonin application. Part of neurons were inhibited by serotonin and did not react to extract application. Inhibitory reactions induced by extract application were blocked by ritanserin in half of the tested units and were induced due to activation of 5-HT2 serotonin receptors. The extract suppressed excitative spike reactions caused by application of L-glutamic acid. It is concluded, that application of PCB-containing extract in most cases reduced spike activity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and suppressed glutamate transmission.

N2  - Psychoactive mushrooms ("magic mushrooms") have been consumed in northern Europe since the late seventies. Recently, the use of hallucinogenic fungi has become popular among young people again. In autumn, psychoactive mushrooms can be collected from their natural habitats throughout Europe. Some species are cultivated in the Netherlands and are sold in "smartshops" or via Internet. In Germany, dried specimens are sold as "Duftkissen" (aroma pads). The article reviews the common psychoactive species and illustrates medical risks.

N2  - In the context of excessive use of natural or synthetic psychoactive substances, with stimulating, psychedelic and hallucinogenic effects, an increase, if not a recurrence, in consumption of Psilocybe semilanceata has been observed in France over some fifteen years. Psilocybin and psilocin are the active compounds, responsible for the hallucinogenic effects and are a part of the substance group, derived from tryptamine and characterized by an indole nucleus. We report a clinical case observed in an emergency unit and review the historical, epidemiological and pharmacological data now available for these intoxications. Of particular interests in hallucinogenic mushroom abuse are: increased consumption in the context of youth cultural and entertainment movements; possible difficulties in the diagnosis in emergency conditions; possibility of severe and fatal complications.

T1  - Jekyll and hyde revisited: Paradoxes in the appreciation of drug experiences and their effects on creativity
A1  - Ten Berge J. 
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Historically, states of intoxication - like dreams and madness - are seen in either one of two opposed ways. The intoxicated are either "possessed" or "under the influence" of an external agency, or revealing hidden feelings or truths (in vino veritas). Along the same lines, artists who worked during LSD, mescalin or psilocybin intoxication often refer to feelings of either being "possessed" or "liberated," a difference that can be explained partly by their expectations and partly by their evaluations, which both tend to conform to the cultural dichotomy in interpreting the irrational. Both interpretations, however, tend to obscure not only the other, but also - it is posited - the paradoxical nature of the drug experience itself. Analysis of a protocol shows that intoxication might comprise feelings of "possession" as well as "liberation" almost simultaneously, and mediumistic and some psychedelic art shows stylistic traits that can be seen as the visual expressions of both these feelings. It seems that the "demoniacal" and "psychedelic" mode come together in experiential reality, only to be divided in the cultural sphere.

T1  - Psychostimulants and epilepsy
A1  - Zagnoni P.G.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Purpose: The aim of this article is to review the literature on the effects of psychostimulants in epileptic subjects in order to reach a consensus statement regarding the use or abuse of these substances. Methods: Psychostimulant substances have been considered the drugs that share the ability to produce excitation of the CNS leading to convulsions. The stimulation may be at cortical, brainstem, or spinal levels. In this article, the following cortical stimulants are analyzed and discussed: cocaine, amphetamine and related agents, caffeine, cannabinoids, and psychedelic drugs. This review is based on research done using pharmacological textbooks and Medline. Results: The use of cocaine is associated with the occurrence of seizures. The reported frequency varies from 1% to 40% of addicted subjects, based on the typology of the considered study. Amphetamines and related drugs rarely induce epileptic seizures at therapeutic doses, but seizures may occur after the first dosing. Caffeine at high doses may induce epileptic seizures because of its adenosine receptor-antagonizing properties. Marijuana, at variance with other psychostimulants, owing to its serotonin-mediated anticonvulsant action, could have a medical use for the treatment of epilepsy. Psychedelic compounds rarely induce epileptic seizures, but the most common clinical CNS complication after ingestion of ecstasy is the occurrence of seizures. Conclusions: The use of psychostimulants, except for marijuana, can induce single or multiple seizures in healthy subjects.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Objective: This study investigates the drug consumption patterns of a sample of rave attendees in the city of Montreal, Quebec, and seeks to identify the prevalence of 3,4- methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and other drug use in this population. Method: We administered a self-report questionnaire to 210 respondents. For various licit and illicit substances, participants reported their age of first use, number of lifetime uses, and usage in the previous 30 days. Results: We found a significant rank order for the sequence of first use: 1) alcohol, 2) nicotine, 3) cannabis, 4) LSD, 5) psilocybin, 6) amphetamine, 7) cocaine, 8) MDMA, 9) gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), 10) ephedrine, 11) ketamine. Alcohol and cannabis were the most commonly used substances, both in cumulative number of lifetime uses and in usage in the preceding 30 days. MDMA and amphetamine were also notable as the next 2 most popular drugs for use in the preceding 30 days and in terms of those who had tried the drugs at least once. We identified a progressive rank order of experimentation, with early alcohol or cannabis use (or both) associated with the early use of all other drugs tried by more than 25% of the sample. We found MDMA and amphetamine use to be prevalent, as was general experimentation with all drugs studied, other than heroin. Conclusion: Drug consumption levels were substantial in this "rave" population, particularly with respect to recent use of MDMA, amphetamine, cannabis, and alcohol. Results also indicate that the sequence of drug experimentation in this population follows an identifiable pattern.

N2  - Derivatives of psilocin with omega-functionalized alkyl spacers in position 1 of the indole ring were synthesized as haptens for use in a radioimmunoassay. Whereas the psilocin analogues with a 3-aminopropyl and a 4-aminobutyl moiety at the indole nitrogen decomposed during synthesis, the analogous 3-carboxypropyl psilocin derivative proved to be stable. This compound was coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA) using the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-mediated conjugation. The protein-hapten conjugate was characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry data indicated an average incorporation ratio of 4-5 molecules of psilocin hapten per molecule of BSA.

T1  - Possible mechanisms of panic attack and schizophrenia via APUD system
A1  - Fukuda K. 
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Psilocybin poisoning produces biphasic reactions composed of a schizophrenic phase and a panic attack-like phase. There is a time lag of several hours between phases, which may be considered an accumulation time in certain sites between the gut and the brain. So far as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) congeners are concerned, no sites are to be found except the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) system. It is postulated that argyrophil cells (AC) in the foregut, neuroepithelial bodies (NEB) in the lung, and raphe nuclei (RN) in the brainstem axis are relevant to mental disorders. Schizophrenia might be due to the massive destruction of APUD cells, and the paroxysmal release of 5-HT with peptides and panneuroendocrine markers from NEB might be the cause of panic attack. © 2002 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

N2  - Three categories of drugs, and specific commonly used drug subcategories are examined in this paper: depressants (benzodiazepines, methadone), stimulants (cocaine), and hallucinogens (cannabis). Descriptive, epidemiological studies on the incidence of drugs in driving populations show that cannabis or benzodiazepines are the most common drugs detected in most industrialized countries. The large number of experimental studies on the impact of various drugs on psychomotor performance show that the effects of the three categories of drugs and specific drugs with each category vary considerably. Some psychoactive drugs within these three categories have the potential to alter the skills required for driving. Analytic epidemiological studies, where comparison groups are utilized, provide the best information on the role of drugs in traffic crashes. The most rigorous epidemiological studies have been conducted on benzodiazepines and traffic crashes. Generally, benzodiazepine users are up to 6 times more likely to be in crashes than non-users, depending on the study; however, the effects can be mitigated by altering the mode and type of prescriptions. In terms of the other types of drugs, the research is less rigorous and has not clearly shown they are associated with increased rates of traffic crashes.

N2  - Hallucinogenic drug-induced states are considered as models for acute schizophrenic disorders (experimental psychoses). In a double-blind study with healthy volunteers we investigated the influence of the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin, the ecstasy-like drug 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDE), the stimulant d-methamphetamine and placebo on covert orienting of spatial attention (n = 8 in each group). Reaction times were prolonged after ingestion of psilocybin > MDE, but not after d-methamphetamine. In addition, subjects on psilocybin exhibited particularly slow reaction times in invalid trials at short cue target intervals and failure of response inhibition in valid trials at long cue target intervals for right visual field targets. Despite some methodological limitations, these results are in line with both bilateral impairment of disengagement of attention and a lateralized impairment of inhibition of return (IOR) in productive psychotic states. Additional investigations with larger samples, different hallucinogenic substances (serotonergic agonists vs. NMDA antagonists) and different dose regimens are needed in order to further explore the suggested relationship between visuospatial attentional dysfunction and acute psychotic conditions.

T1  - Psychotropic drugs in developmental mushrooms: A case study review
A1  - Gross S.T. 
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Psilocyn and psilocybin can be identified in different stages of developing psilocybe mushrooms. Knowing the various stages of the mushroom development can be useful when receiving evidence from illicit mushroom growing operations. Exhibits from three separate cases were submitted to the drug analysis section of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Forensic Science Laboratory, Each case contained different stages of developing mushrooms. This report describes the evidence in each case, the sample preparation, the sample analysis and the final report that was written.

N2  - Poisonous mushrooms contain toxins that are as diverse as the mushrooms themselves. Clinical syndromes often involve multiple organ systems, and progression of clinical signs is often directly related to the quantity eaten. Diagnostic detection of the toxins is rarely an option; rather, diagnosis is based on a history of possible exposure and identification of mushroom species in the stomach contents and environment. Treatments are usually based on clinical signs, as most mushroom toxins are without an antidote. There are exceptions, however, and prompt identification of mushroom species involved is vital whenever possible. Collection of the toxicologic minimum database and gastrointestinal decontamination are important in all cases where mushroom ingestion is suspected.

T1  - The adrenochrome hypothesis of Schizophrenia revisited
A1  - Smythies J. 
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - This paper reviews the current status of the adrenochrome theory of schizophrenia. An account is first given of all the experiments in which adrenochrome was reported to induce psychotomimetic effects in normal volunteers. Then the evidence is presented that adrenochrome may actually occur in the brain as a metabolite of adrenaline in the C2 group of adrenergic neurons in the medulla, together with an account of current ideas of the function of these neurons in higher limbic functions. Lastly the recent evidence is reviewed that the gene for the enzyme glutathione S-transferase is defective in schizophrenia. This enzyme detoxifies adrenochrome.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Background: Previous studies indicate that mismatch negativity (MMN) - a preattentive auditory event-related potential (ERP)-depends on NMDA receptor (NMDAR) functioning. To explore if the strength of MMN generation reflects the functional condition of the NMDAR system in healthy volunteers, we analyzed correlations between MMN recorded before drug administration and subsequent responses to the NMDAR antagonist ketamine or the 5-HT2a agonist psilocybin. Methods: In two separate studies, MMN was recorded to both frequency and duration deviants prior to administration of ketamine or psilocybin. Behavioral and subjective effects of ketamine and psilocybin were assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the OAV Scale - a rating scale developed to measure altered states of consciousness. Correlations between ERP amplitudes (MMN, N1, and P2) and drug-induced effects were calculated in each study group and compared between them. Results: Smaller MMN to both pitch and duration deviants was significantly correlated to stronger effects during ketamine, but not psilocybin administration. No significant correlations were observed for N1 and P2. Conclusions: Smaller MMN indicates a NMDAR system that is more vulnerable to disruption by the NMDAR antagonist ketamine. MMN generation appears to index the functional state of NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission even in subjects who do not demonstrate any psychopathology. © 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

T1  - Drugs of abuse monitoring in blood for control of driving under the influence of drugs
A1  - Moeller M.R.
A1  - Kraemer T. 
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Driving under the influence of drugs is an issue of growing concern in the industrialized countries as a risk and a cause for road accidents. In forensic toxicology, the increasing number of samples for determination of drugs in blood is mainly due to zero-tolerance laws in several countries and well-trained police officers who can better recognize drivers under the influence of drugs of abuse. This review describes procedures for detection of the following drugs of abuse in whole blood, plasma, and serum: amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA), N-ethyl-3, 4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDEA), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), cannabinoids (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC], 11-hydroxy-delta-9-THC, 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-THC), cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ecgonine methyl ester, cocaethylene, the opiates (heroin, 6-monoacetylmorphine, morphine, or codeine), and methadone as well as gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), phencyclidine (PCP), and psilocybin/psilocin. For many of the analytes, sensitive immunologic methods for screening are available. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is still the state-of-the-art method for confirmatory analysis or for screening and confirmation in one step. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) procedures for such purposes are also included in this review. Basic data about the biosample assayed, internal standard, workup, GC or LC column and mobile phase, detection mode, reference data, and validation data of each procedure are summarized in two tables.

N2  - In a clinical study eight volunteers received psilocybin (PY) in psychoactive oral doses of 212+/-25 mug/kg body weight. To investigate the elimination kinetics of psilocin (PI), the first metabolite of PY, urine was collected for 24 h and PI concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with column switching and electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Sample workup included protection of the unstable PI with ascorbic acid, freeze-drying, and extraction with methanol. Peak PI concentrations up to 870 mug/l were measured in urine samples from the 2-4 h collection interval. The PI excretion rate in this period was 55.5+/-33.8 mug/h. The limit of quantitation (10 mug/L) was usually reached 24 h after drug administration. Within 24 h, 3.4+/-0.9% of the applied dose of PY was excreted as free PI. Addition of beta-glucuronidase to urine samples and incubation for 5 h at 40degreeC led to twofold higher PI concentrations, although 18+/-7% of the amount of unconjugated PI was decomposed during incubation. We conclude that in humans PI is partially excreted as PI-O-glucuronide and that enzymatic hydrolysis extends the time of detectability for PI in urine samples. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

T1  - Effects of ayahuasca on sensory and sensorimotor gating in humans as measured by P50 suppression and prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex, respectively
A1  - Riba J.
A1  - Rodriguez-Fornells A.
A1  - Barbanoj M.J. 
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Rationale: Ayahuasca, a South American psychotropic plant tea, combines the psychedelic agent and 5-HT2A/2C agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) with) beta-carboline alkaloids showing monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties. Current human research with psychedelics and entactogens has explored the possibility that drugs displaying agonist activity at the 5-HT2A/2C sites temporally disrupt inhibitory neural mechanisms thought to intervene in the normal filtering of information. Suppression of the P50 auditory evoked potential (AEP) and prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI) are considered operational measures of sensory (P50 suppression) and sensorimotor (PPI) gating. Contrary to findings in lower animals, unexpected increases in sensorimotor gating have been found in humans following the administration of the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin and the serotonin releaser 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). In addition, to our knowledge P50 suppression has not been assessed previously in humans following the administration of a 5-HT2A/2C agonist. Objectives: To assess the effects of the acute administration of ayahuasca on P50 suppression and PPI in humans, in order to evaluate the drug's modulatory actions on these measures of sensory and sensorimotor gating. Methods: Eighteen healthy volunteers with prior experience of psychedelic drug use participated in a clinical trial in which placebo or ayahuasca doses (0.6 mg and 0.85 mg DMT/kg body weight) were administered according to a double-blind, cross-over balanced design. P50 and startle reflex (pulse-alone and 60 ms, 120 ms, 240 ms and 2000 ms prepulse-to-pulse intervals) recordings were undertaken at 1.5 h and 2 h after drug intake, respectively. Results: Ayahuasca produced diverging effects on each of the two gating measures evaluated. Whereas significant dose-dependent reductions of P50 suppression were observed after ayahuasca, no significant effects were found on the startle response, its habituation rate, or on PPI at any of the prepulse-to-pulse intervals studied. Conclusion: The present findings indicate, at the doses tested, a decremental effect of ayahuasca on sensory gating, as measured by P50 suppression, and no distinct effects on sensorimotor gating, as measured by PPI.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Applications of capillary electrophoresis (CE) for analysis of phytochemical substances (e.g. flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolic acid, quinones and coumarins) are reviewed. For example, CE analysis of sixteen tea ingredients were achieved within 10 min with the good precision (RSDs% < 1% for intra-day and 2% for inter-day) and linearity (R2 > 0.990). Quantitation of sanguinarine and chelerythrine, alkaloids from Sanguinaria canadensis L. or Macleaya cordata (Wild) Br. R. by CE showed excellent linearity (R2 > 0.998), precision (RSD% = 1.8%) and detection limit (2.4-3.0 muM). Determination of antraquinone-1-sulphonate was also obtained by this technique with good linearity (R2 > 0.9999), precision (RSD% = 2%) and detection limit (0.7 mug/ml). Results of CE analysis from several studies are comparable to those of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), but the former is more useful for complex mixture samples where the analysis demands higher resolving power. Advantages of CE are high efficiency, low cost, short analysis time and simplicity, whereas disadvantages include low sensitivity comparing to HPLC and limitation of the preparative scale. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

N2  - Psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) is the major psychoactive alkaloid of some species of mushrooms distributed worldwide. These mushrooms represent a growing problem regarding hallucinogenic drug abuse. Despite its experimental medical use in the 1960s, only very few pharmacological data about psilocybin were known until recently. Because of its still growing capacity for abuse and the widely dispersed data this review presents all the available pharmacological data about psilocybin.

N2  - The mechanisms underlying the abusive consumption of illegal or medicinal drugs are reviewed. They correspond to two main sets of processes, those of addiction (also called psychological dependence) and those of tolerance and withdrawal reactions (also called physical dependence). Both phenomena are discussed with regard to their clinical implications and their consequences for the choice of rational therapeutic approaches. Taking into account the pharmacological aspects of drug abuse, in addition to its psychological and social aspects, is of prime importance to clarify the medical management of abuser patients.

T1  - Drug addiction. Part I. Psychoactive substances in the past and presence
A1  - Vetulani J. 
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Substances capable of changing the functions of the central nervous system are widely distributed in plant kingdom, and many of them were discovered by ancient food-gatherers at the dawn of humanity. In the Old World only a few substances producing euphoria or altered states of consciousness and having habit-forming properties are still widely used. They are the products of poppy (opium, morphine), hemp (hashish, marijuana), and of fermentation of various organic materials alkohol. This list has recently been joined by the psilocybin-containing mushrooms. The addiction-forming compounds originated in the New World and widely spread are tobacco (nicotine) and cocaine. In the 19th and 20th, century the development of medicinal chemistry resulted in several synthetic compounds, originally proposed as therapeutics, such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines and amphetamines. Due to legal problems, to avoid production of the substances already prohibited, many designer drugs were manufactured. In addition, several compounds were synthesized as recreational drugs. Also some compounds that were not regarded as drugs, such as aromatic hydrocarbons and other cleansing agents, as well as steroids were found to have properties of dangerous, habit-forming agents. The attitude of society and the pattern of use of psychoactive substances have changed with time, particularly in the last decades. The active principles are now more addictive because of concentration, purification, chemical modifications and the way of ingestion, which now favors most rapid transport to the central nervous system. The substance abuse approaches the level of global epidemics, and the recent usage of drugs of addition is also reviewed.

N2  - The analysis of bulk samples of drugs of abuse, whether it be for the identification, quantification or comparison of different samples follows a simple basic pattern of a physical description, a colour test and where necessary, identification using one or more instrumental techniques. In order to develop a test for these fungi, it is necessary to identify parts of the DNA which are specific to genus. In order to determine this, the DNA was extracted from fungal drugs and PCR was performed on the ITS-1 region. In using this system to identify fungal material to genus, PCR was extracted on extracted DNA using a common primer and genus specific primer.

N2  - The basic aspects of capillary electrophoresis (CE) such as: instrumentation, separation modes and its chief domains of use in forensic analysis are presented. Micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC), capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and chiral separations - the most often used separation modes in drugs analysis - are described. The main directions of development of CE methods in the field of forensic toxicological analysis are described. They are: 1. examination of abused drugs and accompanying compounds in confiscated illegal preparations, 2. analysis of abused drugs in biological samples and 3. determination of other drugs in biological and non-biological material. On the basis of a review of chemical and toxicological literature up to 2000, a variety of examples of CE applications to forensic drugs analysis is given.

N2  - The abuse of designer-drugs (e.g. >>Ecstasy<<, >>MDMA<<) and biogen-drugs (>>thorn-apple<<, >>magic-mushrooms<<) and the subsequent frequency of intoxication from these substances has increased immensely in the recent years. For their curiosity and lack of experience young people are particularly at risk from overdose and consequent lifethreatening complications. After all unknown content of active substances and in case of designer-drugs the unknown additions to the offered preparations (e.g. ephedrine, amphetamine etc.) are increasing the risk of unexpected symptoms or complications. Consequently, there is a growing need for knowledge and strategies to deal with medical complications caused by ecstasy or biogen-drugs. This article provides an overview of the active substances and their pharmacology, in particular ecstasy and the most popular biogen-drugs (datura species, psilocybe species). Moreover, it gives an account of incidents in connection with these substances as described in literature. Intoxication resulting from these agents produce general symptoms of a sympathomimetic or anticholinergic nature (e.g. agitation, tachykardia, mydriasis) and a number of psychic side- and aftereffects (e.g. anxiety, depression, psychosis) are predominant, but dangerous complications (e.g. seizures, hyperpyrexia, rhabdomyolysis, cardiovascular collapse) may also occur. Thus, incidents of any kind call for a clinical monitoring, even if initial symptoms appear to be rather mild. Clinical management should focus on monitoring, diagnostics and symptom orientated therapy. Due to the fast kinetics of the substances a gastrointestinal decontamination is of secondary importance.

N2  - Pharmacokinetic studies of psilocybin in humans have shown the rapid dephosphorylation of psilocybin to psilocin with further conversion to 4-hydroxy-tryptophole (4HT) and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (4HIAA) in plasma. Our study shows that psilocin also undergoes conjugation and can be found in the urine as the psilocin-glucuronide conjugate. Recoveries after enzymatic hydrolysis of the urine with beta-glucuronidase (Helix Pomatia or E. Coli) when compared to non-hydrolyzed urine confirmed the presence of the glucuronide. Detection of psilocin from hydrolyzed and extracted samples was optimized for GC/MS by derivatization with MSTFA. The method developed allows for the detection of psilocin in urine with a limit of quantitation of 10 ng/mL, based on 5 mL of spiked urine. Using this method, our laboratory has confirmed the presence of psilocin in 6 out of 8 urine samples, with concentrations ranging from 10 ng/mL to greater than 200 ng/mL. Before implementation of the hydrolysis and derivatization steps, our limit of detection was 200 ng/mL, based on spiked urine standards. No case samples were positive without hydrolysis and derivatization.

N2  - To determine the characteristics of pregnant women who use Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA), and to identify reproductive risk factors associated with this group of women. Prospective, observational study. Pregnant women who have contacted the Motherisk Alcohol and Substance Use Helpline at The Hospital for Sick Children, in Toronto, about exposure to drugs, chemicals, infection or radiation. All inquiries from December 1998 to October 2000 concerning pregnant women who reported use of MDMA, and control cases of women not exposed to MDMA selected within the same week of the MDMA callers. Age, maternal demographics, pregnancy characteristics, patterns of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use, psychological/emotional status, sexually transmitted disease, MDMA method and pattern of use, and adverse drug reactions after ingestion of MDMA. The 132 pregnant women who used MDMA were significantly younger (mean 23.2 vs. 31.2 years, P<.0001), and had more unplanned pregnancies compared to 122 pregnant nonusers (84.2% vs. 54.3%, P<.05). MDMA users were also more likely to be single (57.0% vs. 18.3%, P<.001), and to be White (82.2% vs. 56.0%, P<.05). Comparably more MDMA users smoked cigarettes (53.8% vs. 19.7%, P<.0001), drank alcohol (66.4% vs. 37.3%, P<.0001), and had significantly more episodes of binge drinking during pregnancy (mean 2.12 vs. 0.05, P<.001). Illicit drugs such as cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, ketamine, gamma-hydroxy butyrate, and psilocybin were used more frequently among the MDMA sample. Over a third of MDMA users reported psychiatric/emotional problems, including 6.5% with a clinically diagnosed condition that was being treated with medication and/or counseling. Pregnant women who use MDMA tend to be young, single, and report psychological morbidity, and have a clustering of risk factors that may compromise the pregnancy and fetus. Smoking, heavy alcohol intake, and polydrug use, combined with a higher than expected rate of unplanned pregnancies, increases the risk of fetal exposure to potentially harmful substances. It is important to account for the range of confounding risk factors among women who use MDMA in order to define possible direct effects of MDMA in pregnancy. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

T1  - Human psychopharmacology of Ecstasy (MDMA): A review of 15 years of empirical research
A1  - Parrott A.C. 
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) or 'Ecstasy' was scheduled as an illegal drug in 1986, but since then its recreational use has increased dramatically. This review covers 15 years of research into patterns of use, its acute psychological and physiological effects, and the long-term consequences of repeated use. MDMA is an indirect monoaminergic agonist, stimulating the release and inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) and, to a lesser extent, other neurotransmitters. Single doses of MDMA have been administered to human volunteers in double-blind placebo-controlled trials, although most findings are based upon recreational MDMA users. The 'massive' boost in neurotransmitter activity can generate intense feelings of elation and pleasure, also hyperactivity and hyperthermia. This psychophysiological arousal may be exacerbated by high ambient temperatures, overcrowding, prolonged dancing and other stimulant drugs. Occasionally the 'serotonin syndrome' reactions may prove fatal. In the days after Ecstasy use, around 80% of users report rebound depression and lethargy, due probably to monoaminergic depletion. Dosage escalation and chronic pharmacodynamic tolerance typically occur in regular users. Repeated doses of MDMA cause serotonergic neurotoxicity in laboratory animals, and there is extensive evidence for long-term neuropsychopharmacological damage in humans. Abstinent regular Ecstasy users often display reduced levels of 5-HT, 5-HIAA, tryptophan hydroxylase and serotonin transporter density; functional deficits in learning/memory, higher cognitive processing, sleep, appetite and psychiatric well-being, and, most paradoxically, 'loss of sexual interest/pleasure'. These psychobiological deficits are greatest in heavy Ecstasy users and may reflect serotonergic axonal loss in the higher brain regions, especially the frontal lobes, temporal lobes and hippocampus. These problems seem to remain long after the recreational use of Ecstasy has ceased, suggesting that the neuropharmacological damage may be permament. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Drug-free Ecstasy polydrug users have shown impairment on tasks of verbal working memory and memory span. Current research aims to investigate how these deficits may affect the learning of verbal material by administration of the Auditory Verbal Learning Task (AVLT) (Rey, 1964). The task provides a learning curve by assessing immediate memory span over multiple trials. Learning strategies are further analysed by tendencies to confabulate as well as demonstrate either proactive or retroactive interference elicited by a novel 'distractor' list. Three groups completed the task: two groups of 14 Ecstasy users (short- and long-term) and one group of 14 polydrug controls. Compared with controls both Ecstasy groups recalled significantly fewer words and made more confabulation errors on the initial three recall trials as well as a delayed recall trial. Long-term users demonstrated increased confabulation on the initial trials and the novel 'distractor' trial, compared with short-term users. Only following repeated presentations were both short- and long-term users shown to perform at control levels. As such, deficits in verbal learning may be more related to storage and/or retrieval problems than problems associated with capacity per se. No interference errors were demonstrated by either of the Ecstasy groups. However, a high level of intrusion errors may indicate selective working memory problems associated with longer-term use of the drug. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A1  - Halpern J.H.
A1  - Pope H.G. Jr. 
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Objective: The illicit use of hallucinogens is reemerging in the United States, especially among well-educated adults and teenagers. These same groups are also frequent users of the Internet. The authors sought to characterize the extent of information about hallucinogens available to Internet users. Method: Using standard Internet search techniques, the authors located 81 hallucinogen-related sites and categorized the information provided. Results: Internet sites offer thousands of pages of information-albeit of questionable accuracy - on how to obtain, synthesize, extract, identify, and ingest hallucinogens. Much of this information has yet to appear in textbooks. By contrast, the authors found few U.S. government agency sites offering cautionary material about hallucinogen use. Conclusions: Using the Internet, potential hallucinogen users can bypass traditional channels of medical information and learn in great detail how to obtain and use numerous drugs with unknown hazards.

N2  - A screening method for 70 psychoactive drugs or drug metabolites in human serum by solid-phase extraction with subsequent high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was developed. Enhanced selectivity of detection was obtained by collision-induced dissociation using two different skimmer voltages for the individual scan. The mass spectra and the retention times of the compounds were incorporated into a self-generated spectra library for identification in screening experiments. The detection limits were found to be between 0.1 and 5 ng/mL serum for the majority of the compounds when measured in the selected ion mode. Because of the very small serum concentrations and the rather tow extraction yield, lysergide could not be detected in this way. It was demonstrated with 140 serum samples from alcohol-related traffic cases that this method is suitable for a routine screening in a forensic laboratory.

T1  - The effect of controlled drugs on the unborn child and fetus
A1  - White S.M. 
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Illicit substance abuse is more prevalent than thought in women of a child bearing age and its incidence is increasing. Although maternal factors, such as poor socioeconomic status, diet, smoking, alcohol and infection, have detrimental effects on the fetuses of drug-abusing mothers, harm is increased due to the pharmacological activity of the drugs themselves. This article reviews the pharmacophysiological interactions between mother and fetus, describes the general effects of substance abuse during each trimester and details the deleterious effects on the fetus of the more commonly abused controlled drugs. © APS/Harcourt Publishers Ltd 2001.

N2  - Owing to their relatively ready availability and their supposedly innocuousness as "natural drugs", such biogenic substances as angel's-trumpet, thorn apple or psilocybin mushrooms have recently been gaining in importance in the drug abuse scene. Since, however, these plants and mushrooms vary considerably in their effects, and are thus very difficult to evaluate in terms of dose and effect, their use repeatedly brings about unexpected reactions, including life-threatening symptoms. Apart from primary detoxification, emergency management of such cases mainly comprises clinical monitoring and, where indicated, symptom-oriented medication. In such a situation, particular importance attaches to the management of extreme mental aberrations such as delirium or psychotic states by sedation and protection of the patient from self-harm. In the event of intoxications with Datura, the development of an anticholinergic syndrome with life-threatening complications must be expected, in which case, antidotal treatment with physostigmine is indicated whenever intractable complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or seizures occur.

N2  - Aims. To describe the patterns of drug use at dance (rave) events in terms of prevalence, frequency, type of drugs used, patterns of use, access and risk-associated behaviours. Design. Self-selecting participant-completed survey. Setting. Three dance events in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. Participants. One hundred and twenty-two drug users (57% males, 43% females), 90% of whom were in employment or education, with an age range of 16-47, 80% between 18 and 23 years. Measurements. Participants who answered "yes" to the question "Have you used drugs for dance events in the past year" reported (i) the prevalence, types and frequency of drugs used; (ii) prevalence and contents of mixing drugs; (iii) accessing drugs; and (iv) engagement with drug-associated risk behaviours. Findings. Over 80% of the participants had used ecstasy and amphetamine, over 30% cocaine and LSD; over 10% nitrites, psilocybin and ketamine and less than 5% had used crack or tranquillizers. Participants reported regular consumption of ecstasy and amphetamine (e.g. 35% used ecstasy and 25% amphetamine on a weekly basis) often taken in combination, with the occasional use of cocaine, LSD, ketamine and psilocybin. Poly- and mixing-drug behaviours were significantly more likely than monodrug usage. Drugs were accessed through friends than from any other source. Eighty-five per cent reported mixing drugs and/or alcohol, 35% driving on drugs, 36% having a bad experience on drugs; 30% unprotected sex; and 0.9% injecting drugs. Women in the sample reported higher consumption than men. Conclusions. Dance-drug use has a characteristic pattern that has implications for health promotion and criminal policy.

T1  - A systems model of altered consciousness: Integrating natural and drug-induced psychoses
A1  - Vollenweider F.X.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Increasing evidence from neuroimaging and behavioral studies suggests that functional disturbances within cortico-striato-thalamic pathways are critical to psychotic symptom formation in drug-induced and possibly also naturally occurring psychoses. Recent basic and clinical research with psychotomimetic drugs, such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist, ketamine, and the serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) receptor agonist, psilocybin, suggest that the hallucinogenic effects of these drugs arise, at least in part, from their common capacity to disrupt thalamo-cortical gating of external and internal information to the cortex. Deficient gating of sensory and cognitive information is thought to result in an overloading inundation of information and subsequent cognitive fragmentation and psychosis. Cross-species studies of homologues gating functions, such as prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex, in animal and human models of psychosis corroborate this view and provide a translational testing mechanism for the exploration of novel pathophysiologic and therapeutic hypotheses relevant to psychotic disorders, such as the group of schizophrenias. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

T1  - Ecstasy use: Cognitive deficits related to dosage rather than self-reported problematic use of the drug

N2  - Previous research has shown drug-free Ecstasy users to demonstrate selective cognitive impairment. However, there seems to be a degree of individual variation in the occurrence of such deficits. The present study aimed to assess whether these cognitive deficits are related to an awareness of problematic Ecstasy use, or to past drug dosage. Twenty regular Ecstasy users who reported experiencing Ecstasy-related problems were compared with 20 Ecstasy users who had not reported any previous problems. The two groups displayed similar past histories in relation to a range of illicit drugs, and were divided into low, medium and high users. The controls comprised 20 illicit recreational drug users who had never taken Ecstasy. Executive task measures comprised the Tower of London (TOL), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) and spatial working memory. Immediate and delayed word recall, matched verbal recognition and recall and simple reaction time were also included. Both Ecstasy groups performed significantly worse than controls on two executive measures: TOL planning time and spatial working memory score. There were no differences in cognitive impairment between the Ecstasy users who complained of problems and those who did not. In both groups, decrement on executive tasks was demonstrated as a function of previous drug dose. The study confirms that heavy Ecstasy polydrug use may culminate in selective executive deficits. It also demonstrates that two differently self-perceived Ecstasy groups showed similar cognitive impairment, despite only one group complaining of problems. Because all Ecstasy participants also consumed a range of other illicit drugs, the results are reflective of Ecstasy polydrug use in individuals who use Ecstasy as a drug of preference.

N2  - Abuse of hallucinogens produced by the fungal genera Psilocybe and Panaeolus are a growing problem. Five species from each of the two genera were examined in this preliminary research and a method that will unambiguously identify fungal samples as being of one of these two genera has been developed. The method uses genus specific DNA sequences within the Internal Transcribed Spacer of the ribosomal gene complex. Amplification of a common DNA product and a genus specific product results in two identifiable products, which facilitates the unambiguous identification of material from these two fungi to generic level.

T1  - Tragic flying attempt under the influence of 'magic mushrooms'

N2  - In this study a fatal case caused by the ingestion of magic mushrooms is reported. After a trip to the Netherlands a young girl had ingested a handful of psilocybe mushrooms with a soft drink. Soon later, she was trying to fly from the window and died in the street while falling from a room situated on the second floor of a house. The victim was not known by the law enforcement authorities to be a chronic drug addict. The autopsy revealed a traumatic cause of death whereas post-mortem toxicological analysis outlined consumption of psilocybin and cannabis. Psilocybin/psilocin content in the mushroom was determined by capillary electrophoresis. The general toxicological screening for drugs was negative except for psilocin and cannabinoids in blood and urine. Quantification of psilocin was done by EI-GC/MS operating in the SIM mode after derivatization with MSTFA and with bufotenin (a constitutional isomer) as internal standard. The concentrations were 0.06 mg/l for heart blood and 0.22 mg/l for femoral venous blood. Moreover, blood levels for cannabinoids were the following: 0.03 mg/l (THC), 0.008 mg/l (11-OH-THC) and 0.09 mg/l (THC-COOH). No psilocin could be detected in hair. This is the first case to our knowledge that psilocybin consumption was indirectly related to a fatal outcome.

T1  - Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry as a routine method in forensic sciences: A proof of maturity
A1  - Bogusz M.J. 
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - The applications of LC-API-MS in routine forensic toxicological casework were presented. This technique has been used for routine determination of several groups of drugs: opiate agonists (like morphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine and their glucuronides, methadone, buprenorphine) cocaine and its metabolites (benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester), amphetamine and other psychoactive phenethylamines, like MDMA, MDE or MDA, benzodiazepine derivatives (flunitrazepam and metabolites, triazolam, bromazepam), hallucinogens (LSD, psilocybin, psilocin) and olanzapine, A common solid-phase extraction procedure for all drugs (with exception of LSD) has been developed. Among two ionization sources, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization appeared more universal and assured generally higher sensitivity. Only in the case of very polar drugs (e.g. psilocin or psilocybin) electrospray ionization was more sensitive. LC-API-MS became a very powerful and flexible method for dedicated analyses of substances of forensic interest. The use of this technique for general, broad applicable screening depends on the establishing of interlaboratory database of standardized mass spectra. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

N2  - Background: During the 1990s, rates of nonmedical drug use among adolescents escalated. We assessed data from 5 cycles of the Ontario Student Drug Use Survey for overall trends in the proportion of students reporting illegal drug use between 1991 and 1999. Methods: The survey is a repeated, cross-sectional, 2-stage cluster-design survey of students enrolled in grades 7, 9, 11 and 13. Outcome measures were prevalence of use of 17 drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, over the 12 months preceding the survey. Results: The rates of drug use increased between 1993 and 1999. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the differences in proportions between 1997 and 1999 indicated significant increases in the overall use of 6 drugs; alcohol (95% CI(diff) 6.1, 1.9-10.3), cannabis (95% CI(diff) 46.3%, 0.2-8.4), glue (95% CI(diff) 2.3, 1.3-3.3), other solvents (95% CI(diff) 5.0, 3.1-6.3), barbiturates (95% CI(diff) 1.9, 0.4-3.4) and hallucinogens such as mescaline and psilocybin (95% CI(diff) 3.5, 0.8-6.9). Fewer grade 7 students in 1999 than in earlier cohorts reported using alcohol or cigarettes by age 9. Interpretation: The public health implications of the findings are mixed. On the positive side, there is no evidence of increases in early onset of drug use. On the negative side, the overall proportion of students reporting illegal drug use has continued to rise.

N2  - The present study assessed drug use and the validity of self-reports of substance use among help-seeking veterans referred to a specialty clinic for the assessment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Patients (n = 341) were asked to provide a urine sample for use in drug screening as part of an evaluation of PTSD. Self-reports of substance use were compared with same-day supervised urine samples for 317 patients who volunteered to participate in a drug screening. Results suggested that self-reports were generally quite valid. Only 8% of the cases involved patients not reporting substance use detected by urine screens. A total of 42% of the participants were identified as using drugs of abuse (excluding alcohol) through self-report and urine drug screens. Among participants using drugs, PTSD diagnosis was significantly associated with greater marijuana and depressant use as compared with stimulant (cocaine and amphetamines) use.

T1  - An approach to drug abuse, intoxication and withdrawal

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - The symptomatic effects of drug abuse are a result of alterations in the functioning of the following neurotransmitters or their receptors: acetylcholine, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, norepinephrine, opioids and serotonin. Anticholinergic drugs antagonize acetylcholine receptors. Dissociative drugs affect all transmitter sites. Opiates act on both opioid and adrenergic receptor sites. Psychedelic drugs stimulate serotonin release, and sedative-hypnotic drugs potentiate the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor. Specific signs and symptoms are associated with the neurotransmitters and receptors affected by each drug class. By recognizing symptomatic changes related to particular neurotransmitters and their receptors, family physicians can accurately determine the drug class and intervene appropriately to counteract drug-induced effects.

N2  - 'Magic mushrooms' is the name most commonly given to psychoactive fungi containing the hallucinogenic components psilocybin and psilocin. Material confiscated by local authorities was examined using morphologic, microscopic, microchemical, and toxicological methods. Psilocybe cubensis was the most popular mushroom in the sample collective, followed by Psilocybe semilanceata, Panaeolus cyanescens and Psilocybe tampanensis. The alkaloid content was determined with <0.003-1.15% of psilocybin and 0.01-0.90% psilocin. Panaeolus cyanescens was the mushroom with highest levels of psilocybin and psilocin.

N2  - Active compounds of some mushrooms e.g. Psilocybe cubensis, Paneolus subalteatus or Stropharia coronilla, the psychotropic agents psilocybin and psilocin, have hallucinogenic effects. In one case of 'magic mushroom' intake, we had to analyse blood and urine. Psilocin was detected in the urine with REMEDi HS. Most of the psilocin was excreted as the glucuronide. Therefore an enzymatic hydrolysis should be the first step in analysis. Free psilocin was determined at a concentration of 0.23 mg/l while the total amount was 1.76 mg/l urine. The concentration of psilocin in serum was too low for detection with REMEDi HS. We proved a GC-MS-method with d3-morphine as internal standard and silylation with MSTFA. Similarly to urine, most of the psilocin in serum was found in the conjugated form. The concentration of free psilocin was 0.018 mg/l, that of total psilocin, 0.052 mg/l serum.

T1  - Detecting psychoactive drugs in the developmental stages of mushrooms
A1  - Gross S.T. 
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - The following questions regarding the detection of psychoactive drugs in mushrooms are addressed: At what stage of the mushroom development can the psychoactive drugs psilocyn and psilocybin be identified, and what effect does light have on the growth of these mushrooms. To answer these questions, Psilocybe cyanescens Wakefield mushrooms were grown from their spores in a controlled setting. At various times of their development, samples were taken and analyzed for psilocyn and psilocybin. Knowing what stage of development the psychoactive drugs can be identified may be useful to law enforcement personnel and forensic chemists. Methanolic extracts of various samples were analyzed by TLC and by GC/MS. It was determined that the mycelium knot stage of the mushroom was the earliest stage at which the psychoactive drugs could be detected. It was observed that light affected the time of development and the appearance of these mushrooms.

T1  - The effects of psychoactive drugs and neuroleptics on language in normal subjects and schizophrenic patients: A review
A1  - Salome F.
A1  - Boyer P.
A1  - Fayol M. 
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - The aim of this survey is to present an overview of research into psychopharmacology as regards the effects of different psychoactive drugs and neuroleptics (NL) on language in normal subjects and schizophrenic patients. Eighteen studies that have investigated the effects of different drugs (alcohol, amphetamines, secobarbital, L-dopa, psilocybin, ketamine, fenfluramine) and neuroleptics (conventional and atypical) on language are reviewed. There are no studies concerning the effects of neuroleptics on language in healthy subjects. The results of the effects of other molecules indicate that language production can be increased (alcohol, amphetamine, secobarbital), rendered more complex (d-amphetamine), more focused (L-dopa) or more unfocused (psilocybin) and clearly impaired (ketamine). For schizophrenic patients, most studies show that conventional neuroleptic treatments, at a therapeutic dosage and in acute or chronic mode, reduce language disorders at all levels (clinic, linguistic, psycholinguistic). In conjunction with other molecules, the classical NL, when administered at a moderate dosage and in chronic mode, modify language in schizophrenia, either by improving the verbal flow and reducing pauses and positive thought disorder (NL + amphetamine) or by inducing an impairment in the language measurements (NL + fenfluramine). Clinical, methodological and theoretical considerations of results are debated in the framework of schizophrenic language disorders. © 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

N2  - This study investigated possible interactions between alcohol and hallucinogens in 22 lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and/or psilocybin users through retrospective structured interviews. Of those who had used LSD with alcohol, 86.7 per cent reported a complete blockade of subjective alcohol effects, while the remaining cases reported a diminished response. In addition, 60 per cent of respondents who had used alcohol and psilocybin together reported a partial antagonism of subjective alcohol effects. T-test analyses revealed that LSD's antagonism of alcohol effects were significantly greater than those associated with psilocybin. It is proposed that LSD's effect on alcohol intoxication may involve interactions with various serotonergic and/or dopaminergic receptor systems. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Histological analysis of the viscera in experimental poisoning with psilocybin-containing mushrooms showed nonspecific changes in all examined organs, presenting as expressed hemocirculatory disorders and intracellular dystrophy. Quantitative histochemical analysis showed appreciable shifts in the activities of enzymes involved in the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial redox processes and of specific enzymes involved in nerve tissue metabolism. This may reflect some features in the direct effects of narcotic alkaloids contained in psilocybin-producing mushrooms.

N2  - An improved procedure to accomplish the O-phosphorylation of 4-hydroxy- N,N-dimethyltryptamine (psilocin 5) is reported that utilizes reaction between the O-lithium salt of 5 and tetra-O-benzylpyrophosphate. The O- benzyl groups were removed by catalytic hydrogenation over palladium on carbon to afford N,N-dimethyl-4-phosphoryloxytryptamine (psilocybin, 1). In view of difficulties encountered in the preparation of 1, it is suggested that 4-acetoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (2) may be a useful alternative for pharmacological studies. The latter was obtained following catalytic O- debenzylation of 4-benzyloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine in the presence of acetic anhydride and sodium acetate.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether the relations between (a) cognitive distortions and aggressive behavior, (b) cognitive distortions and drug use, and (c) aggressive behavior and drug use are moderated by a family history of a substance use disorder (SUD) in adolescent boys. Participants were 165 boys aged 15-17 years with (FH+; n = 75) and without (FH-; n = 90) a family history of SUD. Results indicated that a family history of SUD moderated the relation between cognitive distortions and aggressive behavior and the relation between aggressive behavior and drug use. Family history of SUD did not moderate the relation between cognitive distortions and drug use; however, cognitive distortions were positively related to drug use within both groups.

N2  - The modulating effects of serotonin on dopamine neurotransmission are not well understood, particularly in acute psychotic states. Positron emission tomography was used to examine the effect of psilocybin on the in vivo binding of [11C]raclopride to D2-dopamine receptors in the striatum in healthy volunteers after placebo and a psychotomimetic dose of psilocybin (n = 7). Psilocybin is a potent indoleamine hallucinogen and a mixed 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist. Psilocybin administration (0.25 mg/kg p.o.) produced changes in mood, disturbances in thinking, illusions, elementary and complex visual hallucinations and impaired ego-functioning. Psilocybin significantly decreased [11C]raclopride receptor binding potential (BP) bilaterally in the caudate nucleus (19%) and putamen (20%) consistent with an increase in endogenous dopamine. Changes in [11C]raclopride BP in the ventral striatum correlated with depersonalization associated with euphoria. Together with previous reports of 5-HT receptor involvement in striatal dopamine release, it is concluded that stimulation of both 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(1A) receptors may be important for the modulation of striatal dopamine release in acute psychoses. The present results indirectly support the hypothesis of a serotonin-dopamine dysbalance in schizophrenia and suggest that psilocybin is a valuable tool in the analysis of serotonin-dopamine interactions in acute psychotic states.

N2  - A new method has been developed for the rapid analysis of psilocybin and/or psilocin in fungus material using ion mobility spectrometry. Quantitative analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after a simple one-step extraction involving homogenization of the dried fruit bodies of fungi in chloroform and derivatization with MSTFA. The proposed methods resulted in rapid procedures useful in analyzing psychotropic fungi for psilocybin and psilocin. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Abuse of natural products was frequently noticed among young patients with multiple substance abuse. 180 patients of a rehabilitation clinic for young addicts filled out a questionnaire regarding their regulary consumed drugs. Ayahuasca and cactus, the natural drugs of the 70's are rarely found. The patients frequently consumed psilocybin, amanita and datura. We inform about the toxicological basis of the used drugs. A specific exploration of patients with multiple substance abuse in regard to the use of biological drugs is as necessary as random and multicentre follow-up-studies.

T1  - The new-generation antipsychotics - Integrating the neuropathology and pharmacology of schizophrenia
A1  - Harvey B.H.
A1  - Stein D.J.
A1  - Emsley R.A. 
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Despite a well-established role for dopamine (DA) in the neuropathology of schizophrenia, and the evidence of a hyperdopaminergic state in the schizophrenic brain, many questions still remain. Typical agents acting predominantly on DA D2 receptors are only partially effective. New data now indicate that the interaction between DA and the various DA receptors as well as DA interaction with other transmitter systems, are more critical in deciding the therapeutic success of an antipsychotic than actions on DA alone. These interactions are closely associated with what is being documented regarding the neuro-anatomy, neurobiology and neuropsychology of the disorder. There have been major advances in the understanding of the neuropathology of schizophrenia that, while not replacing the original DA hypothesis, have forced a re-evaluation of our understanding of the disorder. In this paper we present the biochemical and neuropathological basis for schizophrenia and discuss six new atypical antipsychotics according to these theories. Drugs reviewed include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, sertindole and quetiapine. While not a comparative analysis of these drugs, this paper is an appraisal of how their pharmacology correlates with our present knowledge of the disorder and highlights differences among the drugs in this group. These agents therefore possess specifically designed qualities, to varying degrees, promising a significant improvement over earlier agents in terms of treating positive and negative symptoms, with a minimal risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). These qualities include an emphasis on D2 selectivity, D1/D2 balance, DA/serotonin (5HT) balance, D3/D4 selectivity, DA/acetylcholine (Ach) balance and glutamate (Glu)/gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) balance. The drugs are discussed with reference to these criteria. Targeted drug design has created a goal-directed strategy with which to treat schizophrenia. These new antipsychotics appear to have several distinct advantages over their predecessors, and should make a major contribution to the treatment of schizophrenia and the re-integration of these patients into society.

T1  - Contrasting levels of adolescent drug use between adjacent urban and rural communities in Scotland

N2  - Aims. To compare life-time prevalence of illicit drug use between adolescents resident in adjacent urban and rural localities. Design. Samples of schoolchildren attending urban and rural comprehensive schools (n = 2558) were obtained using an identical questionnaire survey method. Setting. Respondents were recruited from 10 schools in two contrasting adjacent local authorities. Five representative schools in each locality were chosen. Participants. All children present in each school, in the two final compulsory school years, were eligible for this study. Measurements. Respondents were asked to provide detailed information about their place of residence and use of illegal drugs. The data obtained in schools were compared with local geographical statistics, such as levels of deprivation. Findings. As expected from the demographics of their respective localities, the urban schools displayed higher levels of deprived children and lower levels of school achievement. These socio-economic differences were not reflected in reported levels of life-time drug use. This was true both between and within the urban and rural samples. Conclusion. These findings suggest that adolescent drug use in Scotland is not particularly concentrated in areas of urban deprivation.

T1  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder: Experimental pharmacology
A1  - Marazziti D. 
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - There is evidence supporting the presence of abnormalities in certain neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and noradrenaline, and in neuropeptides and other mechanisms, such as the immune system in patients with obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the findings implicating serotonin (5- hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) in the pathophysiology of OCD are increasing at a rate not found in any other psychiatric disorder. These abundant findings foster numerous complex questions that await answers. For example, which 5- HT receptor subtypes or other subcomponents of the 5-HT system are principally involved in OCD pathophysiology, and how do they interact with dysfunctions of other systems? In the search for answers to these critical questions, experimental pharmacology represents a key tool for approaching the complexity of the involvement of 5-HT in OCD, and also suggests new potential therapeutic targets. This article summarizes, in part, the presentations and the discussion of the symposium, 'Experimental Pharmacology in OCD,' which was held during the Third International OCD Conference meeting in Madeira, Portugal, in September 1998.

N2  - The neurometabolic effects of the hallucinogen psilocybin (PSI; 0.2 mg/kg), the entactogen 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDE; 2 mg/kg) and the stimulant d-methamphetamine (METH; 0.2-0.4 mg/kg) and the drugs' interactions with a prefrontal activation task were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled human [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucoseFDG-positron emission tomographicPET study (each group: n = 8). Subjects underwent two scans (control: word repetition; activation: word association) within 2-4 weeks. Psilocybin increased rMRGlu in distinct right hemispheric frontotemporal cortical regions, particularly in the anterior cingulate and decreased rMRGlu in the thalamus. Both MDE and METH induced cortical hypometabolism and cerebellar hypermetabolism. In the MDE group, cortical hypometabolism was more pronounced in frontal regions, with the exception of the right anterior cingulate, which tended to be hyperactive. Cognitive activation-related increases in left frontocortical regions were attenuated under all three psychoactive substances, but less so under MDE. Taking into account performance data and subjective reports on task difficulty, these effects may result from different mechanisms across the three groups. Our PSI data are in line with studies on acute schizophrenic patients suggesting frontal overactivity at rest, but diminished capacity to activate prefrontal regions upon cognitive demand. The MDE data support the hypothesis that entactogens constitute a distinct psychoactive substance class, which takes an intermediate position between stimulants and hallucinogens.

N2  - The aim of this study was to contribute to the characterization of the entactogen (ecstasy) substance group. The psychopathological, neuroendocrine and autonomic effects of common recreational doses of the entactogen 3,4- methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDE), the hallucinogen psilocybin, the stimulant d-methamphetamine and placebo were investigated in a double-blind study with healthy volunteers (n = 32). Psychological effects of the drugs were assessed by means of standardized rating scales, self assessment inventories and free descriptions. The most characteristic effects of MDE were pleasant emotional experiences of relaxation, peacefulness, content and closeness to others. However, significant stimulant and hallucinogen-like effects were also present, although the latter were weaker than the effects of psilocybin. MDE elicited the strongest endocrine and autonomic effects among the three drugs, including robust rises of serum cortisol and prolactin, elevations of blood pressure and heart rate, and a moderate, but significant rise of body temperature. The apparent contrast between psychological and autonomic effects (subjective relaxation versus physical activation) was a unique feature of the MDE state. Our findings are in line with both users' reports and results from previous experimental studies, and support the view that entactogens constitute a distinct psychoactive substance class taking an intermediate position between hallucinogens and stimulants.

N2  - Systematic human experimental research with hallucinogenic drugs has a long tradition. Scientific interest in this field faded at the end of the 60ies, but is currently again on the rise. Hallucinogenic drug induced states share many phenomenological features with early and acute productive stages of endogenous schizophrenic and schizophrenia-spectrum psychoses. Therefore, they can be considered as 'models' for these particular stages of the disorders. During the last decades, knowledge about the interactions of psychoactive drugs with the endogenous transmitter systems has accumulated and new modern techniques for the study of brain function have become available. Current research with 'model psychoses' has the potential to identify linking variables between psycho(patho)logical conditions and neurobiological alterations involved in both pharmacologically induced and naturally occurring acute psychotic states. Hence, the hallucinogen induced 'model psychoses' represent useful tools for syndrome-oriented research into the neurobiological mechanisms involved it, psychotic disorders. The present article summarizes historical and current aspects of the research with experimental psychoses.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - We collected and reviewed studies in which neuropsychological tests were administered to users of LSD or other hallucinogens. Interpretation of the studies is limited by various confounding variables, such as subjects' premorbid cognitive and personality function and prior use of other substances. At present, the literature tentatively suggests that there are few, if any, long-term neuropsychological deficits attributable to hallucinogen use. To better resolve this issue, however, it will be important to study larger samples of chronic, frequent hallucinogen users who have not often used other types of drugs.

N2  - While the hallucinogenic mushrooms Psilocybe semilanceata have previously been analyzed for the indole alkaloids psilocybin and baeocystin by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) at pH 11.5, the present work focused on the development of an alternative and complementary capillary electrophoretic method for their identification. Owing to their structural similarity and zwitterionic nature, the compounds were difficult to resolve based on different interactions with cationic or anionic micelles. However, while the attempts with micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) were unsuccessful, rapid derivatization with propyl chloroformate and reanalysis by CZE at pH 11.5 was effective to support identification of the two indole alkaloids. Psilocin was difficult to analyze by CZE at pH 11.5 owing to comigration with the electroosmotic flow. For this compound, the pH of the running buffer was reduced to 7.2 to effectively enhance the electrophoretic mobility.

N2  - Ingestion of DOA by children and adolescents continues to be a prevalent problem. Emergency physicians, particularly those in pediatric institutions, should have an understanding of the screening tests for DOA. Several IA techniques provide a rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive screen for DOA. Nevertheless, the physician must be familiar with the limitations of each laboratory and be aware that a negative toxicology screen does not role out ingestion of many DOA.

N2  - Five cases of patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and who were also known intravenous drug users were identified from the records of a Community Drug and Alcohol Team in South Wales. Psychiatric and medical records were examined retrospectively. All patients were leading chaotic lives, and had poor glycaemic control. Glycaemic control appeared to be related to the extent of intravenous drug use, and improved in those whose intravenous use became more controlled.

N2  - Two modifications of the HPLC-ED method with respect to extraction procedure used have been developed for psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, in human plasma using either liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) or automated on-line solid-phase extraction (on-line SPE). Each type of the sample preparation required a different HPLC system followed by electrochemical detection at 650 to 675 mV. The limit of quantitation of both modifications was 10 ng/ml psilocin. There was no significant difference observable between the LLE and the on-line SPE in terms of method standard deviation (LLE 1.82%, on-line SPE 1.13%) and the analytical results. However, the advantages of on-line SPE in addition to different selectivity were less manual effort, smaller plasma volumes of 400 mul (LLE 2 ml) and a recovery of psilocin in human plasma of nearly 100% (LLE 88%). In contrast to a previous procedure both methods were rapid, simple and reliable and yielded high plasma recoveries. They were used successfully in the quantitation of psilocin in plasma samples obtained from healthy volunteers after p.o. administration of 0.2 mg psilocybin per kg body mass. Plasma concentration curves and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated.

T1  - Recent findings from the Ontario Student Drug Use Survey

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Background: Every 2 years, the Addiction Research Foundation of Ontario, a division of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, sponsors the Ontario Student Drug Use Survey. The results of the surveys conducted in 1995 and 1997 are presented here and compared with results from the early 1990s. Methods: Questionnaires were completed by 3870 and 3990 Ontario public school students enrolled in grades 7, 9, 11 and 13 in 1995 and 1997 respectively. The outcome measures were prevalence of use of 20 types of drugs and other substances, including alcohol, tobacco and prescription drugs, over the previous 12 months. Results: For several drugs the prevalence of use in the previous 12 months had increased from 1993 to 1995, but from 1995 to 1997 there was a significant increase for only one type (hallucinogens such as mescaline and psilocybin). The inhalation of glue declined, and the use of the other 18 types of drugs remained stable. Interpretation: Recent data suggest that increases in adolescent student drug use reported earlier this decade have not continued. However, the stability in rates of drug use is not a justification for complacency in this important area of public health.

N2  - Hallucinogenic drug induced states are useful models for acute episodes of endogenous psychotic disorders. The present article discusses the resemblance of hallucinogen-induced and endogenous psychotic states and summarizes some empirical data on their comparability. The traditional model psychosis strategy offers a valuable tool for the investigation of psychosis- related phemomena with modern techniques, and may help to validate basic neurobiological concepts thought to be related to schizophrenia. A number of methodological aspects should be considered in planning modern experimental studies with hallucinogenic drugs. The issue of adequate control substances is discussed in this article, and a recent experimental study of our group on semantic priming effects under psilocybin, 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDE) and d-methamphetamine is reported. Results suggest an increased availability of remote associations only after ingestion of the hallucinogen psilocybin, but not after ingestion of a psychosis with a hyperfrontal metabolic pattern at baseline, but impaired frontal activation upon cognitive demand of a word association task. The implications of these findings for schizophrenia research are discussed.

T1  - Dr. Leary's concord prison experiment: A 34-year follow-up study
A1  - Doblin R. 
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - This study is a long-term follow-up to the Concord Prison Experiment, one of the best-known studies in the psychedelic psychotherapy literature. The Concord Prison Experiment was conducted from 1961 to 1963 by a team of researchers at Harvard University under the direction of Timothy Leary. The original study involved the administration of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy to 32 prisoners in an effort to reduce recidivism rates. This follow-up study involved a search through the state and federal criminal justice system records of 21 of the original 32 subjects, as well as personal interviews with two of the subjects and three of the researchers: Timothy Leafy, Ralph Metzner and Gunther Weil. The results of the follow-up study indicate that published claims of a treatment effect were erroneous. This follow-up study supports the emphasis in the original reports on the necessity of embedding psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy with inmates within a comprehensive treatment plan that includes post-release, nondrug group support programs. Despite substantial efforts by the experimental team to provide post-release support, these services were not made sufficiently available to the subjects in this study. Whether a new program of psilocybin- assisted group psychotherapy and post-release programs would significantly reduce recidivism rates is an empirical question that deserves to be addressed within the context of a new experiment.

T1  - Hallucinogens, serotonin and obsessive-compulsive disorder
A1  - Delgado P.L. 
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - The serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmitter system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders, especially obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD). Blockade of 5-HT reuptake appears to be an important initial neurobiological event in the therapeutic mechanism of action of antiobsessional drags. However, for reasons that continue to be poorly understood, clinical improvement following initiation of treatment with 5-HT reuptake inhibitors can take up to eight to 12 weeks, and most patients do not fully improve. Recent data suggest that activation of 5- HT(2A) and/or 5-HT(2C) receptors may be important for the improvement of OCD symptoms. Most psychedelic drugs are potent agonists at 5-HT(2A) and 5- HT(2C) receptors and their binding potency to these receptors is strongly correlated with their human potency as hallucinogens. This article will briefly review the relevant clinical and preclinical studies relating to the effects of hallucinogens on OCD. These data suggest that activation of 5- HT2 receptors by hallucinogens may lead to acute reduction of, as well as possible longer-lasting beneficial effects on, the symptoms of OCD. Evidence for and against involvement of 5-HT(2A) and/or 5-HT(2C) receptors in the therapeutic effects of drug therapies for OCD are reviewed. Issues related to the pharmacological properties and safety of psychedelic drugs, when considered as potential treatments for patients with OCD, are summarized. The authors suggest that controlled trials of potent 5-HT2 agonists in people suffering from OCD are warranted.

T1  - Human nature and the nature of reality: Conceptual challenges from consciousness research
A1  - Grof S. 
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Holotropic states (a large special subgroup of nonordinary states of consciousness) have been the focus of many fields of modem research, such as experiential psychotherapy, clinical and laboratory work with psychedelic substances, field anthropology, thanatology, and therapy with individuals undergoing psychospiritual crises ('spiritual emergencies'). This research has generated a plethora of extraordinary observations that have undermined some of the most fundamental assumptions of modem psychiatry, psychology, and psychotherapy. Some of these new findings seriously challenge the most basic philosophical tenets of Western science concerning the relationship between matter, life, and consciousness. This article summarizes the most important major revisions that would have to be made in our understanding of consciousness and of the human psyche in health and disease to accommodate these conceptual challenges. These areas of changes include: a new understanding and cartography of the human psyche; the nature and architecture of emotional and psychosomatic disorders; therapeutic mechanisms and the process of healing; the strategy of psychotherapy and self- exploration; the role of spirituality in human life; and the nature of reality.

N2  - In 1996 samples of suspicious honey preparations were confiscated at the Dutch-German border. The labels on the 50 ml jars indicated that the honey contained Stropharia cubensis (better known as Psilocybe cubensis). The jars were filled with honey with a ca. 1 cm layer of fine particles on the top. The particles were collected and subjected to microscopic and chemical analysis. By microscopy mushroom tissue (plectenchym) and spores typical for the genus Psilocybe were identified in all samples. The HPLC analysis with atmospheric pressure mass spectrometry and diode array detection revealed psilocine but psilocybine was not found. The quantitative analysis was very difficult due to the matrix problems. A search showed that the honey with Psilocybe can be purchased in Dutch coffee shops without any limitations although psilocine and psilocybine belong to listed substances according to Dutch law.

T1  - To be too late as early as possible. About drugs, prevention and youth culture in the Nordic countries

A1  - Svensson B.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Youth culture in the Nordic countries: The northern European family of Nordic countries consists of five members: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. It is, however, difficult to demarcate any 'Nordic culture' that can be set apart from the rest of the world, and indeed the same applies to a 'Nordic youth culture'. International (and most particularly Western) youth culture, has a presence in all the Nordic countries. We have punk rockers, hard rockers, death metal fans, there are straight edgers, hip hoppers, skaters, ravers and mc gangs in all five countries. It is in fact harder to identify subcultural groups or life-styles that only exist in one of these countries. Differences between regions within individual countries are probably greater than differences between the biggest cities in different Nordic countries. So when the drugs experts in different countries say that the use of heroin is on the increase, that ecstasy is gaining a firmer footing, that cannabis and amphetamines are spread out across the whole country, the general pattern can be said apply in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. 'Youth culture' is typically understood as representing the kind of visible youth groups mentioned above. 'Youth' itself is a fluid concept that adapts to what it is used to denote. Sometimes 'youth' is used to refer to a certain age, sometimes to a life situation, sometimes it refers to 'youthhood', a collection of cultural symbols ascribed to youth. Our definition is that youths are people aged between 13 and 25 years, but for youth culture the boundary lines are not applied as rigidly: key elements of youth culture - clothes, magazines, television programmes, music, design - are in large part produced and consumed by people over 25. Research questions and methodology: What kind of association is there to be found between youth culture and drug abuse, what sort of patterns can we detect in drug abuse among youths in general? To what extent are preventive efforts among youths adapted to these possible associations? What kind of experiences have been gained from prevention programmes undertaken in the Nordic countries? For our study of Nordic youth culture, drug abuse and prevention, we have analysed media reports, reviewed ongoing research into youth culture and drug abuse among youths, and looked at evaluations of preventive programmes in the Nordic countries. We have studied the appearance of drugs in youth cultures; how are drugs written about, how are they talked about? We have also reviewed and compared research into youth cultures in the Nordic countries, looking primarily at material within the Nordic countries, but to a certain extent outside them as well. The Nordic family is closely tied up with the surrounding world in respect of research as well. Our portrayal of drug abuse patterns, youth culture and prevention in the Nordic countries today is quite comprehensive rather than detailed. We have aimed in our account at openness, combining sociological, social-psychological and ethnological perspectives. This has consciously been given precedence over a coherent theoretically grounded analysis, which we regard as a natural next step in the work that is now underway. New patterns of abuse: What is happening in the Nordic abuse scene; what sort of new patterns are emerging? Hashish has retained its position as the leading illicit drug. A new addition to the family of cannabis products is skunk, a refined form of marijuana with special properties. In Denmark hashish is established in a different way than in the other Nordic countries. The smoking of heroin is on the increase, in some areas potentially in the nature of an epidemic. Heroin is now accessible even outside major cities. Ecstasy is spreading primarily through the rave scene, as are designer drugs with similar compositions. Amphetamine remains the leading nervous system stimulant and has shifted cocaine into more exclusive environments. LSD and hallucinogenic mushrooms have been rediscovered by youths who already use other illicit drugs. Research has shown unequivocally that the young people who use illicit drugs are also heavy drinkers. Youths today are increasingly turning to drugs that are smoked or taken in pills, i.e. that are easy to use and therefore less frightening. During the 1990s drugs have become less expensive, purer and more easily accessible. Our analyses show that there are two main avenues to drug abuse: one via the deviant career, the other via youth culture. For youths already headed for a deviant career, drugs are an additional layer of problems. It is easy to see how the world of drugs may well appeal to juvenile delinquents, offering as it does ample 'job opportunities' in the form of crime as well as a focal point for a sense of belonging and togetherness. The youth culture avenue to drug abuse implies a process in which drugs are glamorized in a youth culture and new users who have no initial social burden are attracted. It is this avenue that is thought to account for the biggest increase in drug abuse today. A worst-case scenario is a youth culture that is equally effective in propagating illicit drugs as the flower power era of the 1960s. The Norwegian parliamentary report on drug policy provides us with three useful concepts for our analysis: elite, follower and mainstream. These concepts help to illustrate how new trends are first picked up by elites with strong resources; then spread among their admirers, closely following in their footsteps; and then eventually are adopted, to a lesser or greater degree, by mainstream youths. By the time that the large majority of youths have picked up the trend, the elite have already moved on to something new and exclusive. People and drugs: All drugs affect people's sense perception. There are different interpretations of the mechanisms involved. The concepts of drug, set and setting are important to understanding how the effects take place: the drug itself, its strength and quality, its pharmacological properties and the halo around the drug; the set, i.e. the individual's circumstances, frame of mind, health status, expectations with regard to drugs; and the setting, i.e. the context in which drugs are taken, in the company of friends in a secure environment or alone in a stressed situation in unknown territory. The meaning of drugs varies over time. To help shed light on how those meanings may vary, we use the metaphor of a love affair for the relationship to drugs. The first encounter with drugs is like an occasional, temporary affair. It may lead to falling in love, at which point the decision has to be made whether to live separately or together. The relationship may then be endorsed by marriage, giving an added sense of security. The habits and routines and moments of passionate love are increasingly interspersed with hesitation, leading possibly to a decision to split up. Splitting up may mean a divorce from drugs, but the relationship may also be revived after a period of separation. If the divorce is permanent, the individual may continue to live alone, i.e. without drugs. (Sometimes the loneliness is not only metaphorical but very real indeed.) Another possible outcome is a new relationship, with a new drug or with alcohol or (in the best case) with a living human being, a new love affair that may replace the drug. In this new relationship there still remains the risk of escapade, infidelity with the old object of love. We point out in our report that teenagers in all age groups may start trying drugs. Today's new youth culture is highly individualistic rather than collective. It follows that drug prevention cannot be based on considerations of group pressure. To be effective, prevention must also include discussions on the function of substances for young people, on their experiences and on how they can get their kicks out of other things than drugs. People use drugs for different reasons; some are in search of pleasure and excitement or a sense of togetherness, others want to try and break away from what they feel is an unsatisfactory existence. Lack of confidence in the authorities appears to be one of the reasons why their information on drugs has less credence than that of others. It is not only young people whose attitude to their own body is individualistic; the same applies to modern society at large. The human body is now the target of intense manipulation, as evidenced by a certain kind of genetic research, the use of natural products and chic fashion ideals. Openness to new ideas, trying new things, travelling and exploring are characteristic of youths and at once ideals of modern society. All these are ideals that are easy to associate with a positive attitude towards drugs. The capacity of drug users for exploration is clearly reflected in their imagination and inventiveness in the search for drugs: both drug users and drug producers are always one step ahead of the police, social welfare authorities and legislation. Combined with the persistently high levels of youth unemployment and general uncertainty about the future, the drug situation among young people today does give cause for some concern - even though the statistical evidence in the report indicates that the vast majority of young people in the Nordic country do not use drugs. Prevention: How do we get young people even to listen to drug education; and more importantly, how do we get the message across and actually heed the advice? The language of advertisements has proven highly effective in getting young people to embrace new life styles (or at least new products), but there has been less success with 'anti-advertisement campaigns'.

N2  - Mushrooms with psilocybin as the major psychotropic principle ('magic mushrooms') have been used in Central America for thousands of years for cultic purposes. After the Spanish conquest in the 16th century and subsequent repression by the Inquisition this application was continued in secret. It was not until 1958 that the mushroom cult was rediscovered, and subsequently fostered by the Hippie movement in the sixties. After a temporary decline in use, a come-back is observed in the last few years, probably under the influence of 'ecological consciousness'. Psilocybin is a substance with relatively little acute or chronic toxicity. Tolerance occurs rapidly and the addictive potential is minimal. Occasionally, chronic psychological effects have been reported, and, in children, (lethal) hyperthermia and convulsions. Individual health risks of magic muschrooms cannot be excluded, but they are not that common or serious that they form a public health risk. Serious individual risk is present when potential users who are insufficiently trained in mycology confuse more toxic species with magic muschrooms when picking their own mushrooms in the countryside. Spiking of inactive mushrooms with LSD by malafide dealers, or changing to other, more toxic ecological drugs when magic mushroom are unavailable also present a considerable health risk.

N2  - Psilocybin, an indoleamine hallucinogen, produces a psychosis-like syndrome in humans that resembles first episodes of schizophrenia. In healthy human volunteers, the psychotomimetic effects of psilocybin were blocked dose-dependently by the serotonin-2A antagonist ketanserin or the atypical antipsychotic risperidone, but were increased by the dopamine antagonist and typical antipsychotic haloperidol. These data are consistent with animal studies and provide the first evidence in humans that psilocybin-induced psychosis is due to serotonin-2A receptor activation, independently of dopamine stimulation. Thus, serotonin-2A overactivity may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and serotonin-2A antagonism may contribute to therapeutic effects of antipsychotics.

T1  - The standardized psychometric assessment of altered states of consciousness (ASCs) in humans
A1  - Dittrich A. 
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - The APZ questionnaire was developed in order to explore hypotheses on ASCs. First - in a series of 11 experiments using different induction methods on N = 393 healthy subjects - the hypothesis was tested that ASCs have major dimensions in common irrespective of the mode of their induction. In the International Study on Altered States of Consciousness (ISASC) the external validity of the experimental results was assessed. The ISASC was carried out on a total of N = 1133 subjects in six countries. The main results of the experimental studies were corroborated in the field studies. The results can be summarized as follows: the common denominator of ASCs is described by three oblique dimensions, designated as 'Oceanic Boundlessness (OSE)', 'Dread of Ego Dissolution (AIA)' and 'Visionary Restructuralization (VUS)'. The reliability and validity of the scales are satisfactory. Tested versions of the APZ scales are available in English (UK, USA), German, Italian and Portuguese. Psychometrically as yet untested versions exist in Dutch, Finnish, French, Greek, Spanish and Russian. The APZ questionnaire has become the international standard for the assessment of ASCs, thus helping to integrate research. A psychometrically improved version exists in German (OAV questionnaire). The BETA questionnaire, which measures the dimensions 'Vigilance Reduction (VIR)' and 'Auditive Alteration (AVE)' is also available in German. These dimensions are most likely etiology-dependent.

T1  - Methodological issues of human experimental research with hallucinogens
A1  - Gouzoulis-Mayfrank E. 
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Human experimental research with hallucinogenic drugs is potentially able to identify linking variables between the psycho(patho)logical conditions and neurobiological alterations involved in both pharmacologically induced and naturally occurring acute psychotic states. A number of methodological aspects should be considered when planning modern experimental studies with hallucinogenic drugs. The issues of subject selection, repeated measures, and adequate control groups are discussed in this paper. Examples of recent experimental studies are presented which take these aspects into account. The first study examined psychopathological changes, facial expression and semantic priming effects during a psilocybin-induced state. In the second study, semantic priming effects after intake of psilocybin, 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDE), and d-methamphetamine were investigated. Results confirmed time-dependent effects of psilocybin and the restriction of increased priming effects in the psilocybin group.

T1  - Advances and pathophysiological models of hallucinogenic drug actions in humans: A preamble to Schizophrenia research
A1  - Vollenweider F.X. 
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Recent research into the pharmacological mechanism of hallucinogens (LSD, psilocybin) and dissociative anesthetics (PCP, ketamine) suggest that multiple neurotransmitter systems are involved in drug-induced and possibly also in naturally occurring psychoses. Specifically, animal models suggest that a dysbalance between serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine in the limbic cortico-striato-thalamic circuitry may be critical to psychotic symptom formation. To test this hypothesis, psychometric measures and metabolic PET investigations were performed (1) with FDG to elucidate the common neuronal substrates of different hallucinogens, (2) with specific receptor ligands before and after pretreatment with specific receptor antagonists to explore the putative interactions of hallucinogens with various neurotransmitter systems. Our data demonstrate that the neuronal substrate of normal and abnormal thought and behavior is associated with a distributed neuronal network and with multiple interactive neurotransmitter systems. The data also support the view that the hallucinogen challenge paradigm constitutes a powerful tool for elucidating the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.

N2  - Schizophrenic patients exhibit deficits in indices of sensorimotor gating, such as habituation and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex. Hallucinogenic drug-induced states are putative models for the early and acute stages of schizophrenic and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Hallucinogenic drugs have been shown to disrupt PPI and/or retard habituation of the startle reflex in animal models of schizophrenia, consistent with the view of hallucinogen-induced states as 'model psychoses'. We evaluated the effects of the hallucinogen psilocybin on PPI and habituation of the startle reflex in a double-blind, placebo-controlled human study with 12 healthy subjects. In contrast to animal studies, in our small human sample, psilocybin increased PPI, while having no clear effect on habituation (n = 6). These findings must be considered preliminary because several factors, including dose regimens and experimental parameters, may influence the results of studies on startle plasticity. Further investigations both with psychotic patients in different stages of the disease and with human and animal models of schizophrenia are needed in order to explore the effects of hallucinogens on sensorimotor gating and the relationship between information processing in hallucinogenic drug-induced states and the naturally occurring psychoses.

T1  - Recreational use of 'Ecstasy' (MDMA) is associated with elevated impulsivity
A1  - Morgan M.J. 
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Recent preclinical evidence suggests that repeated exposure to 3, 4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA; 'Ecstasy') produces long-term reductions in serotonin (5-HT) levels. 5-HT has been implicated in the regulation of mood, anxiety, aggression, impulsivity, and cognition. Accordingly, in the first of two separate studies, these variables were investigated in three groups: (1) MDMA group-recreational ecstasy users (who also used other illicit substances); (2) polydrug controls-who had never taken ecstasy, but otherwise had drug histories and personal characteristics similar to the ecstasy users; and (3) nondrug controls-who had never used illicit drugs, but had similar personal characteristics. All participants completed mood (Likert) scales, personality questionnaires (which included the impulsiveness, venturesomeness and empathy questionnaire-IVE), spatial span and 'Tower of London' (TOL) tests, and a behavioural measure of impulsivity, the matching familiar figures test (MFF20). There were no group differences in mood, anxiety, anger/hostility, and cognitive performance, but the MDMA group committed significantly more errors in the MFF20. Subsequently, a larger sample of participants were administered mood (the General Health Questionnaire or GHQ) and personality (IVE) questionnaires before the administration of a TOL test, followed by the MFF20, and a second TOL test. Although there were no group differences in TOL performance, ecstasy users were again found to commit more errors in the MFF20 than polydrug users. Furthermore, the GHQ and IVE scores of the ecstasy users in the second study indicated, respectively, that they were more psychologically disturbed and impulsive than nondrug controls. The combined data from the two studies indicated that ecstasy users exhibited elevated impulsivity on both self-report and behavioral measures and that those who had taken the most ecstasy had the most elevated trait impulsiveness scores. These findings are consistent with previous evidence that elevated levels of impulsivity in humans are associated with reduced levels of serotonergic function.

N2  - The use of mushrooms containing the hallucinogenic substance psilocybin for intentional intoxication is relatively common. Occasionally, this results in adverse reactions with typical tachycardia that is not evidently caused by psilocybin. This study demonstrates the presence of phenylethylamine in the species Psilocybe semilanceata using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and shows that the amount of this substance may vary much more than that of psilocybin. The highest amount of phenylethylamine (146 mug/g wet weight) was observed in mushrooms from a case of three young men hospitalized because of adverse reactions. Comparison of the symptoms observed in clinical cases of magic mushroom intoxication with those after intake of pure psilocybin or phenylethylamine suggests that phenylethylamine might have a role in the development of adverse reactions to Psilocybe mushroom intake.

N2  - In order to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of psilocybin (PY), the main psychoactive compound of Psilocybe mushrooms, high performance liquid chromatographic procedures with column-switching coupled with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) for reliable quantitative determination of the PY metabolites psilocin (PI) and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (4HIAA) in human plasma were established. Sample work-up includes protection of the highly unstable phenolic analytes with ascorbic acid, freeze-drying and in-vitro microdialysis. The data of two controlled clinical studies with healthy volunteers are presented. The subjects (N = 6 for both studies) received single oral PY doses of 0.224 +/- 0.02 mg/kg b.wt. (10-20 mg) and intravenous doses of = mg PY, respectively. Peak plasma levels of PI after oral administration of PY were measured after 105 +/- 37 min showing an average concentration of 8.2 +/- 2.8 ng PI/ml plasma. 4HIAA peak concentrations of 150 +/- 61 ng/ml plasma were found 113 +/- 41 min after ingestion of PY. After intravenous administration, a mean PI maximum plasma concentration of 12.9 +/- 5.6 ng/ml plasma was found 1.9 +/- 1.0 min after injection. The maximum plasma levels appearing within a very short period indicate a rapid dephosphorylation of PY also when administered systemically. 4HIAA was not detected after = mg of intravenous PY. Estimates for the absolute bioavailability of PI after oral administration of PY were 52.7 +/- 20% (N = 3).

N2  - To date, the ketamine/PCP model of psychosis has been proposed to be one of the best pharmacological models to mimic schizophrenic psychosis in healthy volunteers, since ketamine can induce both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. At subanesthetic doses, ketamine has been reported to primarily block N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex giving support to a glutamate deficiency hypothesis in schizophrenia. Positron emission tomography was used to study ketamine-induced psychotic symptom formation in relation to cerebral metabolic alterations in healthy volunteers. Our study shows that NMDA receptor blockade results in a hyperfrontal metabolic pattern. Increased metabolic activity in the frontomedial and anterior cingulate cortex correlated positively with psychotic symptom formation, in particular with ego pathology. Analysis of correlations between syndrome scores and metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglu) or metabolic gradients (ratios) revealed that each psychopathological syndrome was associated with a number of metabolic alterations in cortical and subcortical brain regions, suggesting that not a single brain region, but distributed neuronal networks are involved in acute psychotic symptom formation.

N2  - A capillary zone electrophoretic (CZE) method was developed for the rapid determination of psilocybin in Psilocybe semilanceata. Following a simple two step extraction with 3.0+2.0 ml methanol, the hallucinogenic compound was effectively separated from matrix components by CZE utilizing a 10 mM borate-phosphate running buffer adjusted to pH 11.5. The identity of psilocybin was confirmed by migration time information and by W spectra, while quantitation was accomplished utilizing barbital as internal standard. The calibration curve for psilocybin was linear within 0.01-1 mg/ml, while intra-day and inter-day variations of quantitative data were 0.5 and 2.5% R.S.D., respectively. In addition to psilocybin, the method was also suitable for the determination of the structurally related compound baeocystin.

N2  - The effects of the indolehallucinogen psilocybin, a mixed 5-HT2 and 5-HT1 agonist, on regional cerebral glucose metabolism were investigated in 10 healthy volunteers with PET and [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) prior to and following a 15- or 20-mg dose of psilocybin. Psychotomimetic doses of psilocybin were found to produce a global increase in cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglu) with significant and most marked increases in the frontomedial and frontolateral cortex (24.3%), anterior cingulate (24.9%), and temporomedial cortex (25.3%). Somewhat smaller increases of CMRglu were found in the basal ganglia (18.5%), and the smallest increases were found in the sensorimotor (14.7%) and occipital cortex (14.4%). The increases of CMRglu in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, temporomedial cortex, and putamen correlated positively with psychotic symptom formation, in particular with hallucinatory ego disintegration. The present data suggest that excessive 5-HT2 receptor activation results in a hyperfrontal metabolic pattern that parallels comparable metabolic findings associated with acute psychotic episodes in schizophrenics and contrasts with the hypofrontality in chronic schizophrenic patients.

Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Psychotherapeutic treatment with hallucinogens, usually called psycholytic treatment, was used at Modum Bads Nervesanatorium (MBN) on inpatients from 1961 to 1976. The hallucinogens used were LSD, psilocybin, and CZ 74. The indications and the treatment procedure at MBN are described. From 1961 to 1976, 379 patients received 2205 psycholytic treatments, mostly with LSD. From 1970 to 1976, only nine patients had their first hospitalization with psycholytic treatment. Sociodemographic data, diagnoses, length of hospitalizations, and number and kind of treatments were registered. Of the treated patients, 40% were women and 60% were men. The diagnostic distribution (ICD 7) was psychoses, 4.5%; obsessive neurosis, 11.1%; other psychoneuroses, 26.3%; sexual deviation, 6.3%; other disorders of character, 46.2%; alcoholism, 5.0%; and drug addiction, 0.5%. In 1961 it was especially obsessive neurosis (35.7%) that was treated, and in the last 7 years it was again the same diagnosis (75.6%). The mean length of hospitalization for the psycholytically treated patients was 132 days, nearly double the average of 68 days for all hospitalized patients at MBN.

Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Hallucinogenic drugs have been inhaled, ingested, worshipped, and reviled since prehistory. With the purification and synthesis of bontanical preparations and the ensuing discovery of chemically unique agents, hope was raised regarding their therapeutic potential, but this hope has been clouded by an epidemic of abuse and an inventory of adverse effects. This review examines aspects of that controversy, including the history of hallucinogens, epidemiology of current hallucinogens, epidemiology of current hallucinogen abuse, the association of LSD use with prolonged psychoses and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, and the efforts to demonstrate the drug's therapeutic efficacy. Human subject ramifications in hallucinogen experimentation are discussed. Future lines of research are suggested in human, animal, and tissue culture paradigms.

T1  - A review of the usefulness of the standard EEG in psychiatry
A1  - Hughes J.R. 
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - The goal of this paper is to draw conclusions about the usefulness of the standard EEG in psychiatry. In general, two thirds of psychiatric referrals for an EEG are expected to provide useful information. The emphasis in schizophrenia is placed on left-sided abnormalities, especially on the left temporal area. In mood disorders the emphasis is on right-sided foci, in addition to the controversial 6/sec spike and wave complexes, small sharp spikes and positive spikes. In the acute stage of alcoholism, a relationship is seen between the degree of intoxication and the amount of slow activity, while in the chronic stage an increase in slow activity is seen, but another change is fast activity on the temporal areas. During withdrawal a low seizure threshold can be seen as irregular bilateral spike and wave complexes. During abstinence 2-4 yr may be required before slow wave sleep is normal in all regards. Among the organic mental syndromes, delirium shows slow activity, except in delirium tremens, which often is associated with a normal record with fast activity. In dementia the prevalence of EEG abnormalities is related to the degree of impairment. After five sessions of ECT diffuse slow waves are often seen. In other conditions, among developmental disorders about one half of autistic children show abnormalities and epileptiform activity is not uncommon. Mild nonspecific abnormalities are seen in about 40% of dyslexics and also in behavior disorders. Anxiety disorders include anorexia nervosa, showing abnormal background activity related to the effect of starvation on cerebral metabolism. In panic attacks paroxysmal activity can be seen. In borderline personality positive spikes have been (again) associated with impulsivity and 6/sec spike and wave complexes with interpersonal problems. Of the drugs of abuse psilocybin and phencyclidine are often associated with generalized epileptiform patterns and with marijuana the alpha shows a decreased frequency with increased amplitude. Typically, an increase in slow activity is seen with psychotropic drugs if there is a change in the level of awareness. Finally, distinctive personality traits are, at times, seen in temporal lobe epilepsy and the phenomenon of 'forced normalization' may appear when seizures stop and psychotic symptoms appear.

N2  - To date, there is no doubt that dopamine plays a key role in the behavioural disorders associated with schizophrenia. However, dopamine is not the only neurotransmitter involved in this syndrome, as it interacts with many neuronal systems in brain. Of special interest is the interaction between dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems with evidence from pharmacological data in animals that each of these systems may exert an inhibitory influence on the other. Furthermore, the psychotomimetic effects of drugs affecting serotoninergic neurotransmission such as LSD, psilocybin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine also contributed to draw attention onto a possible involvement of serotoninergic systems in at least some of the disorders typical of schizophrenia. This idea received strong support from recent studies on the multiple receptors for serotonin in the central nervous system. These studies not only demonstrate the existence of several classes of serotonin receptors called 5-RT(1A), 5-HT(1B), 5-HT(1C), 5-HT(1D), 5-HT2, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4, but led also to the development of novel agonists and antagonists for the stimulation or blockade of each of them. Pharmacological investigations with these ligands revealed that serotonin is probably involved in the behavioural disorders associated with schizophrenia through its binding to three distinct classes of receptors: 5-HT(1A), 5-RT2 (or the closely related class 5-HT(1C)) and 5-HT3, indeed, 5-HT(1A) agonists (8-OH-DPAT, buspirone) as well as 5-HT2 antagonists (notably ketanserin and ritanserin, which prevent the psychotomimetic effects of dimethoxy-aminopropane derivatives) have been shown to enhance the antipsychotic effects of neuroleptics, and to reduce the incidence of involuntary movements in patients treated with the latter drugs. In addition, studies in rats demonstrated that selective 5-HT3 antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron, zacopride, at very low doses: 0.1-2 mug/kg i.p.) can prevent the (direct or indirect) activation of central dopaminergic neurotransmission due to various treatments (chemical stimulation of dopamine-containing cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area; local injection of amphetamine or dopamine directly into the nucleus accumbens, etc). These observations led to the idea of developing drugs with both antidopamine and 5-HT(1A) agonistic and/or 5-HT2 and/or 5-HT3 antagonistic properties as more potent and secure neuroleptics. Interestingly, clozapine which is known as a potent antipsychotic agent with very low incidence of involuntary movements in schizophrenic patients is both an antagonist at dopaminergic receptors (especially D2 and D4), and a blocker of 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. One can expect that the renewed interest for this compound will stimulate the search for novel antipsychotics acting at both dopaminergic and serotoninergic receptors.

N2  - Research in experimental psychosis has a long tradition extending through several stages. With the world wide abuse of psychoactive substances it came to an abrupt end. Systematic questions within this framework of research are still unresolved, and research on newly developed compounds is almost completely lacking. A review of the pharmacological and phychological effects of various psychoactive agents is provided, and results of recent experimetnal studies on arylalkanamines are discussed. It is argued that from a systematic as well as from a methodological viewpoint the traditional approach of expermental psychosis represents a valuable tool in psychiatric research.

T1  - A neurocomputational approach to delusions
A1  - Spitzer M. 
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - Neuronal networks process information in parallel. The cortex can be viewed as a computational surface that creates and maintains dynamic maps of representations of important sensorimotor and higher-level aspects of the environment and the organism. Its functions can be modeled by a particular type of neural network, the self-organizing feature map. Most importantly, representations of information in the cortex and in these maps have been demonstrated to change dynamically according to the salience and frequency of the input. This feature is referred to as neuroplasticity. The fact that general operational characteristics of computational maps in the cortex can be fine-tuned according to specific processing needs is referred to as neuromodulation. Within this framework of cortical maps and their computational models, acute and chronic delusions are discussed in terms of neuromodulation and neuroplasticity. This neurocomputational approach provides new insights into the phenomena in question, is detailed enough to allow empirical testing, and has therapeutic implications.

T1  - Hallucinogenic drugs in psychiatric research and treatment
A1  - Strassman R.J. 
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - Clinical research with hallucinogens has resumed after a generation's hiatus. To place these new studies in context, this article reviews the history of hallucinogens' use and abuse,, discusses their pharmacological properties, and highlights previous human studies. Research with lysergic acid diethylamide and related hallucinogens with thousands of patients and control subjects was associated with acceptable safety when subjects were carefully screened, supervised, and followed up. Data were generated regarding hallucinogens' psychopharmacology, overlap with endogenous psychoses, and psychotherapeutic efficacy. Current American and European studies emphasize systematic psychopharmacology, in addition to psychotherapy protocols. Human hallucinogen research will help define unique mind-brain interfaces, and provide mechanistic hypotheses and treatment options for psychiatric disorders. It is critical that human hallucinogen research in the 1990s make use of state of the art methodologies, or consensually define when modifications are required. Training and supervisory issues also must be explicitly addressed.

T1  - Salvia divinorum and the unique diterpene hallucinogen, salvinorin (divinorin) A
A1  - Valdes III L.J. 
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - Salvia divinorum is a vision-inducing mint used by the Mazatec people of Oaxaca, Mexico. It is grown in California and other parts of the United States where it is employed as a legal hallucinogen. Traditional opinion has been that the plant has mild psychotropic activity, at best. However, when ingested in the correct manner, it is quite powerful. The fresh leaves are chewed as a quid and kept in the mouth. They may also be eaten raw or prepared as an aqueous infusion. When dried, they are smoked in the manner of marijuana. The neoclerodane diterpene, salvinorin A (also known as divinorin A), has been demonstrated in animals and humans to be its major active ingredient. Essentially inactive if taken orally, the compound is effective in doses of 200 to 500 mcg when smoked in a manner similar to cocaine free base. This makes salvinorin A the first documented diterpene hallucinogen and the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogen thus far isolated. This is somewhat remarkable, since the compound is not an alkaloid. This article reviews the use of S. divinorum and its chemistry. In addition, it discusses the effects of the plant and salvinorin A in animals and humans, as well as their potential to become drugs of abuse.

N2  - Hallucinogenic drugs (psychedelics, e.g. Psilocybin, Mescalin, LSD) induce in humans qualitatively altered states of consciousness (ASC), which can be used as experimental models for endogenous psychosis. However, some researchers claim that these ASCs are not appropriate models for schizophrenia. We report two clinical cases of acute endogenous psychoses demonstrating striking similarities to psychedelic experiences. We consider the psychedelic-induced ASC to be an appropriate model for the beginning acute endogenous psychotic episode, but not for the schizophrenic disease as a nosological entity.

N2  - Several specimens of Psilocybe and Copelandia species in Koh Samui, Thailand were recently collected for herbarium deposit and scientific study. This paper presents an ethnomycological and biochemical study of one of the species; P. samuiensis Guzman, Bandala and Allen, a new psychoactive gill fungus reported from Thailand. Mycelium for the cultivation of P. samuiensis was obtained on 6% malt agar from the spores of a dried specimen. The growth of P. samuiensis was similar to that of P. tampanensis Guzman and Pollock, but more rapid than the mycelium of P. semilanceata (Fr.: Sacc.) Kumm. Laboratory analyses indicates that the alkaloid content in cultured fruit bodies of P. samuiensis is of the same order of magnitude as that found in naturally occurring mushrooms of this species. HPLC analyses of both naturally occurring and in vitro cultivated fruit bodies of P. samuiensis revealed high concentrations of psilocybin and psilocin. Small amounts of baeocystin were also detected. Psilocybin levels varied from 0.23% up to 0.90%. The psilocybin content was highest in the caps. Psilocybin was also found in the cultured non-bluing mycelia of P. samuiensis and varied from 0.24% to 0.32% dry weight. The relative alkaloidal content of psilocybin, psilocin, and baeocystin found in P. samuiensis was similar to that measured in many other psychoactive fungi species, but completely different from that found in P. semilanceata.

Y1  - 1994//
N2  - The relationship between religious experience and alternative states of consciousness is as old as humanity itself. From time immemorial, visionary states have been entered through the ritual use of mind-changing substances. Despite the uncontroverted fact that particular substances have been used for thousands of years to achieve religious experiences and insights, the federal drug laws fail to accommodate religiously motivated users. The purpose of this article is to present a model from which such a nonsectarian accommodation may be developed, while retaining the federal scheme for the strict control of drugs.

Y1  - 1994//
N2  - We conducted a random survey of illicit drug use by undergraduate students at a private southern university in 1990 and compared the results with results from a similar 1986 survey of that college's student population. During the 4 years since the first study, the prevalence of cocaine use declined from 39% to 21%, and use of traditional amphetamines declined from 22% to 12%. No significant differences were found in the use of marijuana- 68% in 1986, 64% in 1990-or in use of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide)-14% in 1986, 17% in 1990. The use of mescaline/psilocybin increased from 8% to 24% and the use of MDMA, known as 'Ecstasy' (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), increased from 16% to 24%. Mescaline/psilocybin and Ecstasy were more likely than the other drugs to have been used first during the students' college years, according to the 1990 study.

T1  - Clinical symptomatology and management of mushroom poisoning
A1  - Koppel C. 
Y1  - 1993//
N2  - Among poisonous mushrooms, a small number may cause serious intoxication and even fatalities in man. Humans may become symptomatic after a mushroom meal for rather different reasons: (1) ingestion of mushrooms containing toxins, (2) large amounts of mushrooms may be hard to digest, (3) immunological reactions to mushroom-derived antigens, (4) ingestion of mushrooms causing ethanol intolerance, and (5) vegetative symptoms may occur whenever a patient realizes that there might be a possibility of ingestion of a toxic mushroom after a mushroom meal. Based on the classes of toxins and their clinical symptoms, seven different types of mushroom poisoning can be distinguished: (1) phalloides, (2) orellanus, (3) gyromitra, (4) muscarine, (5) pantherina, (6) psilocybin, and (7) gastrointestinal mushroom syndrome. Two other entities of adverse reactions to mushrooms are (8) coprinus and (9) paxillus syndrome. Phalloides, orellanus, gyromitra and paxillus syndrome may lead to serious poisoning, which generally requires treatment of the patient in an intensive care unit. Diagnosis of mushroom poisoning is primarily based on anamnestic data, identification of mushrooms from leftovers of the mushroom meal, spore analysis, and/or chemical analysis. Therapeutic strategies include primary detoxification by induced emesis, gastric lavage and activated charcoal, secondary detoxification, symptomatic treatment and rarely specific antidotes. Owing to progressing fulminant hepatic failure, lethality associated with phalloides syndrome is still high (5-20%). Basic treatment includes administration of silibinin and penicillin G, although controlled studies on its therapeutic efficacy are still lacking. In serious phalloides syndrome, orthotopic liver transplantation has to be considered. Fortunately, the prognosis in most other mushroom poisonings is excellent.

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - A survey among Danish students revealed that 33 (7.2%) of the respondents had experience with hallucinogenic mushrooms (HM). Afterwards these students answered an extended questionnaire about habits and pattern of consumption. It seems that mushroom use is experimental and may be due to risk-seeking behaviour but is mostly recreational and restricted to a few events. Age over 25 years and male sex were statistically related to a higher lifetime consumption rate of HM. The age of first time users was significantly lower for marijuana than for HM. Only 15 of the respondents wanted to continue use. Most of them were males and they had significantly more friends with HM experience than those who would not continue. We recommend that surveys of drug abuse include questions concerning HM to monitor the trends and extent of HM abuse.

N2  - The use of HPLC with continuous on-line post-elution photoirradiation followed by either diode-array UV or thermospray mass spectrometric detection is presented. These tandem techniques can greatly increase specificity of analysis, as demonstrated by select compounds whose UV or thermospray mass spectra are highly similar under lamp off conditions but significantly different after photoirradiation. The utility of the above approach for various compounds of forensic interest is presented.

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - Acute phencyclidine intoxication causes psychosis and a myriad of other symptoms and signs, some life-threatening. Anticholinergic poisoning is also a medical emergency, often requiring an intensive care unit. Marijuana and hallucinogens have rarely, if ever, resulted in direct overdose death, but intoxication can result in accidents or self-injury. Inhalants cause death from cardiac arrhythmia, suffocation, or accident. Each of these agents is associated with a variety of medical and neurologic complications, some of which are discussed at greater length elsewhere in this issue.

N2  - HY-APATITE is a high-purity calcium hydroxyapatite with primary application in the medical field, for bone implants. Its suitability as a liquid chromatographic (LC) column packing material for the analysis of sugars, alkaloids, enzymes and proteins was investigated. Experiments with sintered HY-APATITE were promising. The regular material was found to be mechanically unstable and, therefore, not suitable for LC. Results are presented for both regular and sintered HY-APATITE columns.

N2  - Citing recently published challenges to R. Gordon Wasson's identification of Vedic soma as the psychoactive mushroom Amanita muscaria (fly-agaric), this article reviews unpublished letters by Wasson in which he considered and rejected other psychoactive plants as candidates, including the mint Lagochilus inebrians, Convolvulaceae (morning glory) seeds, the fungal parasite Claviceps purpurea (ergot), and especially the psilocybin mushroom Stropharia cubensis, known also as Psilocybe cubensis. Apart from their historical interest, these letters-from the Tina and Gordon Wasson Ethnomycological Collection at the Harvard Botanical Museum-demonstrate that Wasson remained open to refinements of his theory.

N2  - Visual art was used to teach the biopsychiatric model of addiction to audiences in the Caribbean, Europe and Mideast. Art slides were tangentially linked to slides of pharmacological data. Stylistically dense art was processed by the intuitive right brain while spare notational pharmacological data was processed by the intellectual (rationalistic) left brain. Simultaneous presentation of these data enhanced attention and retention. This teaching paradigm was based on the nonliterate methods developed by Medieval architects and refined by Italian Renaissance philosopher, Marsilio Ficino.

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - Several fungi species collected in the Hawaiian Islands have been reported to be psychoactive. Previous chemical analyses together with the present study indicate that 5 coprophilous and one non-coprophilous species occurring in the islands are now known to contain psychoactive alkaloids. At least some of these species are consumed in the Hawaiian Islands, as well as elsewhere, for non-traditional, recreational purposes. These include Copelandia cyanescens (Berk. et Br.) Singer, Copelandia tropicalis (Ola'h) Singer and Weeks (syn. Panaeolus tropicalis Ola'h), Copelandia anomala Murrill, and Panaeolus subbalteatus (Berk. and Br.) Sacc., which have already been described from the Hawaiian Islands. Three more mind-altering fungi and one non-psychoactive species are reported from this archipelago for the first time. These psychoactive fungi include Copelandia bispora (Malencon et Bertault) Singer and Weeks from O'ahu, Copelandia cambodginiensis (Ola'h et Heim) Singer and Weeks from O'ahu, and Amanita muscaria (L.) Hooker from Kaua'i. Panaeolus goossensiae Beeli identified from O'ahu contains tryptamine compounds; however, the psychoactive alkaloids psilocybin and psilocin were not found in this dung species.

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - A procedure is outlined for comparing dependence potential and acute toxicity across a broad range of abused psychoactive substances. Tentative results, based on an extensive literature review of 20 substances, suggested that the margin of safety ('therapeutic index') varied dramatically between substances. Intravenous heroin appeared to have the greatest risk of dependence and acute lethality; oral psilocybin appeared to have the least. Hazards due to behavioral deficits, perceptual distortion, or chronic illness were not factored into the assessments.

T1  - Tryptamine: A metabolite of tryptophan implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders
A1  - Mousseau D.D. 
Y1  - 1993//
N2  - Although early interest in the biomedical relevance of tryptamine has waned in recent years, it is clear from the above discussion that the study of tryptamine is worthy of serious consideration as a factor in neuropsychiatric disorders. The study of [3H]-tryptamine binding sites indicates an adaptive responsiveness characteristic of functional receptors. The question raised by Jones on whether tryptamine is acting centrally as a neurotransmitter or a neuromodulator still remains mostly unanswered, although the evidence cited within this review strongly suggests a modulatory role for this neuroactive amine. The synthesis and degradative pathways of tryptamine, as well as the intricate neurochemical and behavioral consequences of altering these pathways, are now more fully understood. It is not yet clear what the role of tryptamine is under normal physiological [homeostatic] conditions, however, its role during pathological conditions such as mental and physical stress, hepatic dysfunction and other disorders of metabolism (i.e. electrolyte imbalance, increased precursor availability, enzyme induction or alterations in enzyme co-factor availability) may be quite subtle, perhaps accounting for various sequelae hitherto considered idiopathic. The evidence for a primary role for tryptamine in the etiology of mental or neurological diseases is still relatively poor, although the observations that endogenous concentrations of tryptamine are particularly susceptible to pharmacological as well as physiological manipulations serve to reinforce the proposition that this indoleamine is not simply a metabolic accident but rather a neuroactive compound in its own right. Finally, one might wonder what proportion of the data attributed to modifications of 5-HT metabolism might, in fact, involve unrecognized changes in the concentrations of other neuroactive metabolites of tryptophan such as tryptamine.

N2  - Maria Sabina (d 1985) is the descendent of the XVIth century Mexican healers, modern priestess of the main actor of the Oratorio the hallucinatory mushroom, an object of a very ancient cult at Huatla (Oaxaca) and described by Fr. Bernardino de Sahagun in the XVI(th) cent. Chronical. The spanish writer C.-J. Cela who received in 1989 the Nobel Price, recreates the healer's incantation, through poetry, rhythms, phonetic percussion, out of a real space and time and inexorably guiding the healing woman toward her sacrifical death. The Oratorio appears as the mimesis of a cathartic strain as it has been described in Aristoteles' Poetica, thanks to the Therapy of the word.

N2  - On the one hand, the analysis of the molecular mechanisms of psychotomimetic drugs has lead to the hypothesis of a chemical cause of schizophrenia, on the other hand the clinical application of psychotomimetics has been proved to be a heuristic laboratory model to study experimental psychopathology. To explore the pathophysiological significance of drug-induced cerebral metabolic changes under psychotic conditions (model-psychosis), the effect of psychotomimetics such as amphetamine, ketamine and psilocybin on cerebral energy metabolism has been investigated using PET and [18F]-FDG in a group of healthy volunteers. Because of the increasing importance of the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, the clinical and molecular aspects of the ketamine-model-psychosis are thoroughly discussed. The glutamate hypothesis is mainly based on the observation that PCP and ketamine (under subanesthetic conditions) selectively block the glutamatergic NMDA receptor complex and will induce a psychotic mental state that closely resembles schizophrenia. The ketamine induced metabolic 'hyperfrontality' supports indirectly the PET-findings as seen in acute hallucinating and drug-naive schizophrenics. Moreover, the observed hyperfrontality supports the supposed involvement of the glutamatergic neurotransmission in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. To illuminate the glutamate hypothesis, a heuristic model of neuronal sensory information processing is advanced which takes into account evidence from our functional PET-studies as well as from studies of experimental psychopharmacology and from the recent findings in postmortem schizophrenic brains.

N2  - As part of a larger survey of health-related behaviours, 2239 15-16-year-olds in Wales provided information on their use of eight different types of drugs. Key findings indicate that just over a fifth of this age group report to having tried drugs at some time, while a tenth say they have done so within the past month. The most frequently reported substances were marijuana, solvents and glue, and psilocybin. Few of the young people reported multiple or regular drug use. The prevalence of drug use was higher for pupils from single parent families, and more boys than girls reported using psilocybin. The reliability and validity of self-report data are discussed, and the implications of the findings for health education programmes considered.

N2  - The aim of this questionnaire survey was to investigate the extent of hallucinogenic mushroom consumption among students from a high school in the county of Aarhus, Denmark and among students at the University of Aarhus and students from the Danish school of journalism in Aarhus, Denmark. 3% of the high school students had used psilocybine-containing mushrooms as a hallucinogen. Only 1% had experience with LSD. Of the students at the University of Aarhus, and students from the Danish school of journalism in Aarhus, 333 persons (83%) returned the anonymous questionnaire. 9% had experience with hallucinogenic psilocybine containing mushrooms while only 2% had LSD experience. The use of hallucinogenic mushrooms was surprisingly high. This suggest that mushrooms are the most commonly used hallucinogenic substance in Denmark and that the use has exceeded that of LSD. Compared to non-users mushrooms users had significant more friends with mushroom experience. Furthermore, the study shows that the intention to use mushroom is commoner in persons who have friends with HPS experience. We find that the use of mushroom takes place in minor groups known to each other. Compared to non-users, mushroom-users are significant more experienced with marijuana and other substances. Unfortunately, our data do not permit us to show whether mushroom users are more inclined to try other drugs or whether persons with a high drug experience use mushrooms as well. Further investigation on the subject is recommended.

A1  - Strassman R.J. 
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - The absence of relevant human research studies of hallucinogenic drugs has not curtailed their unsupervised use. Two cases are presented that suggest decreased sensitivity to the serotonergic hallucinogens psilocybin and LSD induced by drugs with effects on serotonergic neurotransmission, allopurinol and fluoxetine. These reports suggest that hallucinogens' effects in humans are mediated by serotonergic receptors.

T1  - The phenomenon of substance abuse among the elderly: Part I

Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Because substance abuse, already a major problem among elderly people, is expected to worsen significantly during the 1990s, healthcare providers must be better prepared to identify and deal effectively with this important area of geriatric care. We present an overview of the phenomenon of substance abuse among the elderly with particular attention to the abuse of alcohol and benzodiazepines, the two substances most commonly abused by elderly people. Traditionally, substance abuse among the elderly has gone largely unrecognized because of a low level of suspicion, misdiagnosis, and concealment. It is axiomatic that problems cannot be solved unless they are first identified and appropriately characterized. To respond to the increasing problem of substance abuse among the elderly, healthcare providers must recognize that elderly people are at particular risk for substance abuse, and because of their heterogeneity, they require individualized and diverse prevention and treatment approaches. Once the abuse is identified and properly characterized, specific prevention and treatment strategies can be developed and implemented.

The separation method includes a new efficient extraction procedure, optimization programme for high-performance liquid chromatographic separation, identification by diode-array detection and a spectrometric and electrochemical assay. The identification of indole alkaloids was confirmed by thin-layer and gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The method was used for analysis and isolation of psychotropic substances in extracts from the fruit bodies of hallucinogenic fungi of genera Psilocybe, Inocybe and Amanita and in mycelial extracts from the species Psilocybe bohemica.

T1  - Psychoactive mushroom use in Koh Samui and Koh Pha-ngan, Thailand
A1  - Allen J.W.
A1  - Merlin M.D. 
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - This paper presents the results of recent ethnomycological exploration in southern Thailand. Field observations. interviews and collection of fungi specimens were carried out primarily on two islands, Koh Samui and Koh Pha-ngan, situated in the western region of the Gulf of Siam. Some fieldwork was also conducted in the northern Thai province of Chiang Dao and in the southern Thai province of Surat Thani. During five separate excursions (1989-90), observations were made of occurrence, harvesting, use, and marketing of psychoactive fungi by local Thai natives (males and females, adults and children), foreign tourists, and German immigrants. The first records of psychoactive Psilocybe subcubensis and Copelandia dung fungi in Thailand are presented in this paper. These fungi exhibited intense bluing reactions when handled, indicating the presence of psilocybin and/or psilocin. Seven collections of Psilocybe cubensis (Earle) Singer and/or Psilocybe subcubensis Guzman and four collections of Copelandia sp. were harvested and sun-dried for herbarium deposit. These fungi are cultivated or occur spontaneously, often appearing in the decomposed manure of domesticated water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and at least three different species of cattle (Bos indicus, B. guarus, and B. sundaicus). The psychoactive fungi are cultivated in clandestine plots, both indoors and outdoors, in the uplands and villages on Koh Samui by both Thai natives and some foreigners. The sale of psychoactive fungi directly to tourists and to resort restaurants for use in edible food items such as omelettes and soups is discussed in detail. The preparation and sale of mushroom omelettes adulterated with artificial hallucinogens in some restaurants is also discussed. In addition, the marketing of items such as hand painted T-shirts, post cards, and posters bearing mushroom related motifs in Thailand is described.

N2  - The relationship between history of specific types of substance abuse (alcohol, stimulants, cannabis, hallucinogens, narcotics) and demographic and diagnostic variables was evaluated in a large (n = 263) sample of schizophrenic, schizoaffective, major depression and bipolar disorder patients. Prevalence rates were also compared with rates observed in a previous study (1983-1986) conducted using the same methods. Demographic characteristics (gender, age, race, educational level) were strong predictors of type of substance abuse. Patients with a history of cocaine abuse had fewer prior hospitalizations, suggesting that less impaired psychiatric patients may be more prone to illicit substance abuse. Diagnoses were not related to most types of substance abuse, although there was a trend for bipolar patients to have a history of alcohol abuse. The results demonstrate the importance of matching groups on demographic characteristics when exploring diagnostic differences in preference to abuse specific types of substances.

A1  - Buckholtz N.S.

A1  - Freedman D.X.
A1  - Potter W.Z. 
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - A dosage regimen of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) that reliably produces behavioral tolerance in rats was evaluated for effects on neurotransmitter receptor binding in rat brain using a variety of radioligands selective for amine receptor subtypes. Daily administration of LSD [130 mug/kg (0.27 mumol/kg) intraperitoneally (IP)] for 5 days produced a decrease in serotonin2 (5-hydroxytryptamine2, 5-HT2) binding in cortex (measured 24 hours after the last drug administration) but did not affect binding to other receptor systems (5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), beta-adrenergic, alpha1- or alpha2-adrenergic, D2-dopaminergic) or to a recognition site for 5-HT uptake. The decrease was evident within 3 days of LSD administration but was not demonstrable after the first LSD dose. Following 5 days of LSD administration the decrease was still present 48 hours, but not 96 hours, after the last administration. The indole hallucinogen psilocybin [1.0 mg/kg (3.5 mumol/kg) for 8 days] also produced a significant decrease in 5HT2 binding, but neither the nonhallucinogenic analog bromo-LSD [1.3 mg/kg (2.4 mumol/kg) for 5 days] nor mescaline [10 mg/kg (40.3 mumol/kg) for 5 or 10 days] affected 5-HT2 binding. These observations suggest that LSD and other indole hallucinogens may act as 5-HT2 agonists at postsynaptic 5-HT2 receptors. Decreased 5-HT2 binding strikingly parallels the development and loss of behavioral tolerance seen with repeated LSD administration, but the decreased binding per se cannot explain the gamut of behavioral tolerance and cross-tolerance phenomena among the indole and phenylethylamine hallucinogens.

T1  - Involvement of 5-HT receptor subtypes in the discriminative stimulus properties of mescaline

Y1  - 1989//
N2  - In order to further evaluate the extent to which particular 5-HT receptor subtypes (5-HT1, 5-HT2) might be involved in the behavioral effects of hallucinogenic drugs, rats were trained to discriminate mescaline (10 mg/kg i.p.) from saline and were given substitution (generalization) and combination (antagonism) tests with putatively selective serotonergic and related neuroactive compounds. The mescaline cue generalized to relatively high doses of the 5-HT2 agonists, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM), LSD and psilocybin; the extent of generalization of 5-HT1 agonists (8-hydroxy-2-[diethylamino]tetralin (8-OHDPAT), RU-24969 and 8-hydroxy-2-[di-n-propylamino]tetralin (TFMPP)) was unclear. Combinations of the training drug and sufficiently high doses of 5-HT2 antagonists (ketanserin, LY-53857, pirenperone) were followed by saline-lever responding; less selective central 5-HT (metergoline), and DA (SCH-23390, haloperidol) antagonists, did not block the mescaline cue. These data suggest that 5-HT2 receptors are involved in the stimulus properties of mescaline.

N2  - Hallucinogenic drugs are unique in that they produce the desired hallucinogenic effects at what are considered non-toxic doses. The hallucinogenic drugs can be categorised into 4 basic groups: indole alkaloid derivatives, piperidine derivatives, phenylethylamines and the cannabinols. The drugs reviewed include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), phencyclidine (PCP), cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, marijuana, psilocybin, mescaline, and 'designer drugs'. Particularly noteworthy is that each hallucinogen produces characteristic behavioural effects which are related to its serotonergic, dopaminergic or adrenergic activity. Cocaine produces simple hallucinations, PCP can produce complex hallucinations analogous to a paranoid psychosis, while LSD produces a combination of hallucinations, pseudohallucinations and illusions. Dose relationships with changes in the quality of the hallucinatory experience have been described with amphetamines and, to some extent, LSD. Flashbacks have been described with LSD and alcohol. Management of the intoxicated patient is dependent on the specific behavioural manifestation elicited by the drug. The principles involve differentiating the patient's symptoms from organic (medical or toxicological) and psychiatric aetiologies and identifying the symptom complex associated with the particular drug. Panic reactions may require treatment with a benzodiazepine or haloperidol. Patients with LSD psychosis may require an antipsychotic. Patients exhibiting prolonged drug-induced psychosis may require a variety of treatments including ECT, lithium and l-5-hydroxytryptophan.

T1  - Differences in the stimulus properties of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in animals trained to discriminate hallucinogens from saline

Y1  - 1988//
N2  - The stimulus properties of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and several related compounds were compared to those of (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylethylamine) in a two-lever, water-reinforced, drug discrimination task. In animals trained to discriminate LSD (0.08 mg/kg) from saline (n = 8), LSD-like responding occurred during substitution (generalization) tests with sufficiently high doses of (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine, LSD, mescaline, psilocybin and (-)-MDA; saline appropriate responding occurred after (+)-MDA and both (+)- and (-)-MDMA. In animals trained to discrminate mescaline (10 mg/kg; n = 8), (-)-MDA, (+)-MDA, (-)-MDMA and (+)-MDMA as well as (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine, LSD, mescaline and psilocybin mimicked the training drug. Neither (+)-amphetamine nor cocaine produced mescaline-like responding; fenfluramine substituted partially for mescaline but not LSD. Because all of the phenylisopropylamine enantiomers mimicked the potent hallucinogen mescaline (10 mg/kg), these results do not support suggestions that similarities in the behavioral effects of 'designer' drugs such as MDA and MDMA to those of hallucinogens are limited to (-)-MDA. They also indicate that, although LSD and mescaline may be pharmacologically similar (in other assays), these compounds do not have identical stimulus properties.

N2  - To compare the subjective experience of different forms of altered states of consciousness, computerized content analysis was applied to 66 autobiographical accounts of schizophrenia, hallucinogenic drug states, or mystical ecstasy and to 28 autobiographical control accounts of important personal experiences. The patterns of lexical choice used by the four groups were significantly different in word frequencies from 49 of 83 lexical categories measured. When data from the 13 most statistically significant categories were used in discriminant and classification analyses, 84% of the samples were correctly identified by their word frequencies. These findings suggest that the subjective experiences of schizophrenia, hallucinogenic drug-induced states, and mystical ecstasy are more different from one another than alike.

A1  - Schwartz R.H. 
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - The hallucinogen mescaline is found in the peyote and San Pedro cacti, which are prevalent in Mexico and the southwestern United States. In a survey of middle-class, predominantly white adolescents in a drug treatment facility, 18 percent of the respondents indicated that they had taken mescaline. Much of the purported mescaline was probably another hallucinogen, usually LSD. The effects of equipotent doses of mescaline and LSD are almost indistinguishable.

N2  - A large body of data, as well as clinical experience, link prescribed medications and substances of abuse with sexual dysfunction. This review surveys the relevant literature and summarises key points relating various classes of medications and their possible sexual side effects. Surprisingly, there were very few carefully designed, well organised, systematic studies of the effects off medication upon sexual performance. The preponderance of data is in the form of either case studies or collections of patient reports of side effects. A a result, there are great variations in the reported rates of sexual disturbances associated with the administration of a given medication. A further difficulty is the lack of precision in the use of terms which describe the various sexual disorders. A final problem is the almost total lack of data concerning both disordered and normal sexual functioning in females.

N2  - Ingestion of mushrooms containing psilocybin produces hallucinogenic effects and has become a popular form of substance abuse among some adolescents and young adults. We have reviewed the medical literature on psilocybin mushrooms and describe current patterns of use, provide background material on the botony and pharmacology of these crude drugs, and report results of a small study on usage patterns among identified adolescent drug abusers. Among 174 adolescents already identified as substance abusers, 45 (26%) reported having used hallucinogenic mushrooms, frequently in conjunction with alcohol or other drugs. An average intake of 2-4 mushrooms was obtained for about $8, and led to intoxication for 5-6 hours. Mixing of intoxicants such as alcohol, marijuana, and psilocybin mushrooms was the rule. The acute adverse reactions may have been the result of drug synergy. Pediatricians should become aware of the specific patterns of the use of hallucinogenic drugs by adolescents and consider the possibility of such use when evaluating a delerious or psychotic adolescent.

T1  - Qualitative and quantitative determinations of hallucinogenic components of psilocybe mushrooms by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
A1  - Vanhaelen-Fastre R.
A1  - Vanhaelen M. 
Y1  - 1984//
N2  - Several techniques have been used for the determination of psilocin and psilocybin in mushroom extracts, such as paper chromatography, column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography, preceding UV spectroscopy or colorimetry. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry have also been proposed. Gas chromatography requires preliminary derivatization, but high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be applied after simple extraction. Because of its high polarity, psilocybin is not sufficiently retained on reversed phase; therefore, Beug et al. used HPLC to quantitate psilocin and psilocybin in Psilocybe baeocystis, on an octadecyl bonded phase with a paired-ion reagent (heptanesulphonic acid) in an acidic aqueous methanol mobile phase and UV detection. Later, Wurst et al. also used reversed-phase HPLC on an octadecyl bonded phase with an acidic aqueous ethanol mobile phase and double detection by UV spectroscopy and fluorometry for the analysis of psilocybin and psilocin in crude extracts of mushrooms. The isolation of psilocybin and baeocystin on a semi-preparative scale is described. However, as in the Beug method, the poor retention of the polar compounds, namely psilocybin, precludes its accurate quantitation in crude extracts. In this context, the use of reversed-phase HPLC for Psilocybe mushrooms analysis was reinvestigated.

T1  - Correlation of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) binding to brain stem preparations and the production and prevention of myoclonus in guinea pig by 5HT agonists and antagonists
A1  - Luscombe G.

A1  - Marsden C.D. 
Y1  - 1984//
N2  - In guinea pig brain stem preparations [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) bound specifically to both high and low affinity sites, but specific [3H]spiperone binding was low and could not be consistently detected. This indicates a prevalence of 5HT-1 type receptors in this tissue. High affinity-specific [3H]5HT binding was more potently displaced by indole-containing 5HT agonists than by piperazine-containing 5HT agonists. This agreed with the observation that indole-containing, but not piperazine-containing compounds induced dose-dependent myoclonus in guinea pigs which originates from brain stem. The capacity of indoleamine antagonists to displace [3H]5HT-specific binding from guinea pig brain stem was similar to their reported potency in displacing [3H]5HT from 5HT-1 receptors. The [3H]5HT-labelled binding site in guinea pig brain stem is a 5HT-1 receptor and appears to be responsible for the induction of indoleamine-dependent myoclonus.

N2  - A rapid, sensitive and specific method for the screening of hallucinogenic mushrooms has been developed. High-performance liquid chromatography with simultaneous use of ultraviolet, fluorescence and electrochemical detection was empolyed. Separation of the mushroom components was achieved on a silica column using an alkaline aqueous methanolic eluent. The use of detector response ratios for identification of hallucinogenic indole alkaloids has been evaluated.
